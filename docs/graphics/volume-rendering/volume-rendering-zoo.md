     - Technique is basically exponentiation of single scattering with multiple octaves
     - Must make sure $a \leq b$ to be energy conserving
       $$
       \left(x, \omega_{i}\right)=\sum_{0}^{(N-1)} L \operatorname{scat}\left(x, \omega_{i}\right) \\
       \begin{aligned} \sigma_{s}^{\prime} &=\sigma_{s} \times a^{n} \\
       \sigma_{e}^{\prime} &=\sigma_{e} \times b^{n} \\
       p^{\prime}(\theta) &=p\left(\theta \times c^{n}\right) \end{aligned}
       $$

- Take Mean Free Path/Transport mean free path into account
  - The scattering mean free path is the average distance between scattering events (in biological tissues around 100 Î¼m)
  - The transport mean free path can be thought of as the mean distance after which a photonâ€™s direction becomes random (in biological tissues around 1 mm)
  - The **transport length** in a strongly diffusing medium (noted l\*) is the length over which the direction of propagation of the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) is randomized. It is related to the [mean free path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_free_path) l by the relation

# **Notes:**

## Channel Lighting Magik

- Devon's overview of his technique

  > Right now the rays terminate with the max samples per ray, which is ~25, and in general the rays early terminate with a density close to 1. This works for my clouds because they are so dense, and most rays early terminate except for gazing angles.
  >
  > Try to do some experiments with straight ray marching, just for comparison. In my tests, I got nicely convergent renders with a 970 + Vive @ ~1.2ms GPU time, and some overhead for rendering the cloud shell into custom depth (.3-.4ms). There isn't much CPU overhead. This is with 25 samples per ray and my dense clouds with a 3d texture that is 950x950x600
  >
  > So yes, I did bake in 3 lights and denisty into the grid as a preprocess in Houdini
  >
  > in Houdini, I did a whole bunch of volume renders from different angles, and configured it to output ray march points where each point was the attenuated light that reached that point in space.
  >
  > it was a massive amount of data that was then resampled to a vdb grid, then output to a custom format rgba
  >
  > im not totally sure what your dLo and ds are, but the basic idea is to remap the rgb you get at each step, then attenuate that by the transmittance.  While this talk is more based on analytical methods, I like the description for the math:
  > <https://developer.nvidia.com/sites/default/files/akamai/gameworks/downloads/papers/NVVL/Fast_Flexible_Physically-Based_Volumetric_Light_Scattering.pdf>
  >
  > the remap I used was very simple - I just did:
  > VolumeRadianceAtSample = VolumeSample.r \* KeyLightColor + VolumeSample.g \* MultipleScatteringColor + VolumeSample.b \* EnvironmentLightColor
  >
  > and yes, I did apply this at each ray march step rather than at the end.  It'll look a bit better and be more flexible, but in theory, you can remap at the end too (we did that at DreamWorks all the time so you could remap colors in compositing)
  >
  > the key to getting it look good is baking in really solid lighting and using a reasonably high resolution grid
  >
  > and I had a really good lighting artist tweak the lighting channel remapping a lot ðŸ™‚
  >
  > I could try to dig up the math I used too if you get stuck on the numerical integratio

## **Math Reminders**

- Incremental averaging:
  - NewAvg = OldAvg + (NewVal - OldAvg) / NewSampleCount
  - Optimized: Avg = lerp(avg, NewVal, rcp(NewSampleCount))
  - For calculating variance as well: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_variance#Welford's_online_algorithm>
- Closest Point Transform
  - âˆ‡\_sdf() is always unit vector. (SDF is 3D levleset of function embedded in 4D so all level set rules apply)
  - Xcpt(x) = x - sdf(x) \* âˆ‡\_sdf(x)
  - Xcpt(x) => is a conservative field
    - Xcpt(x) = âˆ‡U(x)
    - U(x) = 0.5 \* (|x|^2 - f^2(x))
    - Has no curl

Optimization Reminders

- Optimizing Graphics Pipeline: <https://www.slideshare.net/gwihlidal/optimizing-the-graphics-pipeline-with-compute-gdc-2016>
  - ~.9 prim/cy is a target. 2 prims/cycle is optimistic

### **Curve Fitting**

- Fast Polynomial Eval
  - Horner form for fast polynomial evaluation:
    y = x + a\*x\*x\*x + b\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x + c\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x + d\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x\*x*;* // 24 mults, 4 adds
    z = x\*x; y = ((((z\*d+c)\*z+b)\*z+a)\*z+1)\*x; // 2 mults, 4 madds
- Error metrics
  - Absolute error metric: error_abs = abs(f_actual - f_approx)
    - good measure of accuracy but not of importance of any error
    - Ex: Error of 3 is fine if f(x) returns 38,000. Terrible if function returns 0.0001
  - Relative error metric: 1 - f_approx / f_abs
- Gaussian Quadrature
- Spherical Splines/Polynomials
- Spherical RBFs
