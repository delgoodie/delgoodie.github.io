UE4 packages everything in the project folder by default.

Specify only the maps you care about in DefaultEditior.ini

- UE will then package everything referenced within those files

- **Note:** Unused references are included (default texutres referenced in Materials or isolated blueprint nodes referencing assets). Be sure to clean up your graphs to minimize package size

To build for 64-bit release:

Change this in the source code:

Unfortunately there's no way of switching from the editor UI in the 4.2 build. If you want to change it manually,you can go to FMainFrameActionCallbacks::PackageProject() in Engine\\Source\\Editor\\MainFrame\\Private\\Frame\\MainFrameActions.cpp, and change this bit of code:

```cpp
if (PlatformName == "WindowsNoEditor")
{
if (PackagingSettings->BuildConfiguration == PPBC_Shipping)
{
OptionalParams += TEXT(" -targetplatform=Win32");
}
else
{
OptionalParams += TEXT(" -targetplatform=Win64");
}
}
```

If you get rid of the check for the shipping configuration, it should work.
