## Overview

Console commands are string-based commands that you can run in the game or in the editor. They are also known as *exec commands*.

To use console commands, bring up the console by pressing Tab or Tilde (~), type them in, and press Enter. Console commands may be executed from within the game, from within the editor, or if the game has been started using the -server switch, from the server's console. They can do various things from resetting the engine to setting particular actor's variables.

Lists of commands can also be stored in text files in the system directory and executed by typing exec \_filename\_ at the console.

## Command List

The following is a list of engine supported console commands...
