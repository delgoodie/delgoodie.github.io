// General flow here is like so

​	// - Actor sets up the basics.

​	// - Actor gets PreInitializeComponents()

​	// - Actor constructs itself, after which its components should be fully assembled

​	// - PostActorCreated

​	// - Actor components get OnComponentCreated

​	// - Actor components get InitializeComponent

​	// - Actor gets PostInitializeComponents() once everything is set up
