**Add Custom InitView data (used by Landscape Component):**

```cpp
/**
 * Called during the visibility and shadow setup for each primitives with either static or dynamic relevancy, so we can store custom data for the frame that can be reused later. 
 * Keep in mind this can be called in multihread as it's called during the InitViews()
 * This will only be called if bUseCustomViewData is true in the GetViewRelevance()
 * @param InView - Current View
 * @param InViewLODScale - View LOD scale
 * @param InCustomDataMemStack - MemStack to allocate the custom data
 * @param InIsStaticRelevant - Tell us if it was called in a static of dynamic relevancy context
 * @param InVisiblePrimitiveLODMask - Calculated LODMask for visibile primitive in static relevancy
 * @param InMeshScreenSizeSquared - Computed mesh batch screen size, passed to prevent recalculation
*/
ENGINE_API virtual void* InitViewCustomData(const FSceneView& InView, float InViewLODScale, FMemStackBase& InCustomDataMemStack, bool InIsStaticRelevant = false, const struct FLODMask* InVisiblePrimitiveLODMask = nullptr, float InMeshScreenSizeSquared = -1.0f) { return nullptr; }




/**
 * Called during post visibility and shadow setup, just before the frame is rendered. It can be used to update custom data that had a dependency between them.
 * Keep in mind this can be called in multihread.
 * This will only be called on primitive that added view custom data during the InitViewCustomData.
 * @param InView - Current View
 * @param InViewCustomData - Custom data to update
 */
