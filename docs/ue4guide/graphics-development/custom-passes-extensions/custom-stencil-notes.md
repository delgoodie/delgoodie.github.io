<https://udn.unrealengine.com/questions/266792/using-customdepth-in-material.html>

The gist is to search for "CustomDepth" and do almost the exact same thing, except bind the main scene depth buffer and your custom color buffer, instead of a custom depth buffer. We use this as a mask to blend a scene capture with the main scene view in a postprocess material, but it should work just as well to sample it in base pass materials.

*Reference From <https://udn.unrealengine.com/questions/270970/stencil-testing-opaque-pass.html>*

- Add a new pass to the deferred shading renderer for setting up this texture. Search for bRenderCustomDepth and CustomDepthSet to use the custom depth rendering pass as an example. You won't need any new drawing policies. While rendering to this target you can bind the scene depth buffer so you can depth test against the main scene.

Drawing policies:

Logic to render meshes with pass specific shaders.
Takes set of mesh material shaders + vertex factory => binds vertex factory's buffers to RHI => binds mesh material shaders to RHI => sets shader parameters => issues RHI drawcall

- FVertexFactory to itnerface to abstract mesh type

- FMaterial interface to abstrat material details

FlushRenderingCommands is standard method of blocking the game thread until rendering thread has caught up. Mainly useful for offline/editor operations

FRenderResource: base rendering resource interface (e.g. FVertexBuffer, FIndexBuffer, etc)

- Use helper function BeginInitResource() which calls FRenderResource::InitResource() on the render thread

FRenderCommandFence: Used to sync operations from GT & RT

- UPrimitiveComponent::DetachFence used on deleting

[Great example is USkinnedMeshComponent/USkeletalMesh]

Static Render Resources:

- Initialized using BeginInitResource, usually after PostLoad.

- Component registration happens after which adds primitive/primitivesceneproxy to FScene to start rendering

- GC calls BeginDestroy() to call BeginReleaseResource(IndexBufferRenderRsrc) & DetachFence.BeginFence()

- UPrimitiveComponent::IsReadyForFinishDestroy() - returns if true if DetachFence.IsFenceComplete()

- GC calls FinishDestroy() to actually delete. Usually destructor's handle this

Dynamic Render Resources:

- CreateRenderState_Concurrent to allocate dynamic render thread object (e.g. FSkeletalMeshObject)

  - Should derive from FDeferredCleanupInterface

- SendRenderDynamicData_Concurrent() allocates/computes data on GT and sends them to render thread through ENQUEUE_UNIQUE_RENDER_COMMAND

  - Usually the dynamicData pointer is copied to the dynamic render thread object (e.g. FSkeletalMeshObject.DynamicData) bc the object now owns it and is responsible for freeing it

- DestroyRenderState_Concurrent() is where GT marks dynamic render resources for deletion. Calls

  - Render Thread Object (e.g. FSkeletalMeshObject) calls BeginReleaseResource() on all FRenderResources it owns

  - Calls BeginCleanup() on Render Thread Objects (e.g. FSkeletalMeshObject)

    - Make sure to delete any remaining allocated dynamic data struct that was used to pass stuff between GT to RT in SendRenderDynamicData_Concurrent() (e.g. delete (FDynamicSkelMeshObjectDataCPUSkin\*)DynamicData;)

  - Nullptr out the Render Thread Object. Ex: MeshObject = nullptr

**Approaches to Create separate stencil buffer**

New Pass: Render ArenaMask Sphere into stencil buffer

Create new material domain ? Shading model

Extend view relevance with new arena bit?

Separate render pass, after all opaque?

Extend FrustumCull&lt;>() to cull objects based on View cone direction

## Early-Z/Stencil/Hi-Z/Hi-Stencil/Z-Cull Rules:

TLDR:

- If you force the hardware to go to late-z, it wont' reset until the next zbuffer clear/pipeline flush/next frame

| Alpha test, alpha to coverage or texkill with depth or stencil writes on   | Disabled | Enabled  |
| Alpha test, alpha to coverage or texkill with depth and stencil writes off | Enabled  | Enabled  |
| Stencil op fail or zfail is not KEEP                                       | Enabled  | Disabled |
| Stencil op fail and zfail is KEEP, pass is any op                          | Enabled  | Enabled  |
| Depth test comparison is EQUAL                                             | Enabled  | Enabled  |
| Depth test comparison is NOTEQUAL                                          | Enabled  | Disabled |
| Reversed depth comparison direction                                        | Enabled  | Disabled |
| Reversed stencil comparison direction                                      | Enabled  | Enabled  |

- Don't switch depth comparison direction

- Discard + depth writes OFF => still keeps EarlyZ on

- [earlydepthstencil] + discard + depth writes => color will be discarded but depth will get writtten (bc it already got written to in the earlyz test phase before the pixel shader)

Force earlydepthstencil (if we're not doing an earlyZ pass)

- Make sure z/stencil-fail op == KEEP. Otherwise early/hiZ might get disabled

- Alpha test/texkill/alpha to coverage will disable EarlyZ but sometimes ok with HiZ

Early/HiZ AMD circa 2007:
