Using netserialize for custom struct serialization: <http://www.aclockworkberry.com/custom-struct-serialization-for-networking-in-unreal-engine>

- To define your own NetSerialize and NetDeltaSerialize on a structure
- GameplayDebuggerCategoryReplicator.h, FGameplayDebuggerNetPack, and AGameplayDebuggerCategoryReplicator  are good examples of full netserialization

```cpp
struct FGameplayDebuggerNetPack
class GAMEPLAYDEBUGGER_API AGameplayDebuggerCategoryReplicator : public Aactor
```

**NetSerialization.h has lots of comments:**

```cpp
/**
 * @param Ar                        FArchive to read or write from.
 * @param Map                        PackageMap used to resolve references to UObject\*
 * @param bOutSuccess        return value to signify if the serialization was succesfull (if false, an error will be logged by the calling function)
 *
 * @return return true if the serialization was fully mapped. If false, the property will be considered 'dirty' and will replicate again on the next update.
 *        This is needed for UActor\* properties. If an actor's Actorchannel is not fully mapped, properties referencing it must stay dirty.
 *        Note that UPackageMap::SerializeObject returns false if an object is unmapped. Generally, you will want to return false from your ::NetSerialize
 * if you make any calls to ::SerializeObject that return false.
 *
 */
bool NetSerialize(FArchive& Ar, class UPackageMap\* Map, bool& bOutSuccess)

/**
 * @param DeltaParms        Generic struct of input parameters for delta serialization
 *
 * @return return true if the serialization was fully mapped. If false, the property will be considered 'dirty' and will replicate again on the next update.
 *        This is needed for UActor\* properties. If an actor's Actorchannel is not fully mapped, properties referencing it must stay dirty.
 *        Note that UPackageMap::SerializeObject returns false if an object is unmapped. Generally, you will want to return false from your ::NetSerialize
 * if you make any calls to ::SerializeObject that return false.

bool NetDeltaSerialize(FNetDeltaSerializeInfo & DeltaParms)
