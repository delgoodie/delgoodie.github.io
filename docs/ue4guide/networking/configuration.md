Pass -lanplay command arg to use lan bandwidth settings

### Low Level Constants:

```cpp
enum { MAX_PACKET_SIZE = 1024 }; // MTU for the connection
enum { LAN_BEACON_MAX_PACKET_SIZE = 1024 }; // MTU for the connection

enum { RELIABLE_BUFFER = 256 }; // Power of 2 >= 1.
enum { MAX_PACKETID = 16384 };  // Power of 2 >= 1, covering guaranteed loss/misorder time.
enum { MAX_CHSEQUENCE = 1024 }; // Power of 2 >RELIABLE_BUFFER, covering loss/misorder time.
enum { MAX_BUNCH_HEADER_BITS = 64 };
enum { MAX_PACKET_HEADER_BITS = 15 }; // = FMath::CeilLogTwo(MAX_PACKETID) + 1 (IsAck)
enum { MAX_PACKET_TRAILER_BITS = 1 };
```

### Runtime lag bandwidth data:

UPlayer/UNetConnection:

- CurrentNetSpeed: Actual net speed that gets updated
- MaxPacket: Maximum packet size.
- LastReceiveTime; // Last time a packet was received, for timeout checking.
- LastReceiveRealtime; // Last time a packet was received, using real time seconds (FPlatformTime::Seconds)
- LastGoodPacketRealtime; // Last real time a packet was considered valid
- LastSendTime; // Last time a packet was sent, for keepalives.
- LastTickTime; // Last time of polling.
- QueuedBits; // Bits assumed to be queued up.
- TickCount; // Count of ticks.
- LastRecvAckTime; // The last time an ack was received \*/

**Misc Details:**

- **NetClientTicksPerSecond:** is actually how many client connections the server will tick on each of its frames. Similar for the NetUpdateFrequency values, those control how often the server will consider the actor's properties for replication.

- **bClampListenServerTickRate:** Clamp maxtickrate if listenserver by using NetServerMaxTickRate
