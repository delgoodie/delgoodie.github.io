  - GameModeBase::ProcessServerTravel()
    - StartToLeaveMap()
      - Sets match state to leaving map
    - ProcessClientTravel()
      - Iterates through list of player controllers and calls their client travel if they are Remote players and PreClientTravel if a local player
      - If playing in editor both player controllers are considered local controllers and they get PreClientTravel() called and not ClientTravel()
      - LocalPlayerController::PreClientTravel()
        - Calls delegate broadcast notifying the new level, type of travel and whether it is seamless
    - if(bSeamless)
      - Do Seamless travel
    - else (we are not seamless so we do this)
      - Set World::NextSwitchCountdown = 0 so that switch happens immediately on next Tick in TickWorldTravel()

After the TickWorldTravelI(), the PlayerControllers ClientRestart() and ClientRestart_Implementation get called
