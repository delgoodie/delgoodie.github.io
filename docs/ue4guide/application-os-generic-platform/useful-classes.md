Processes:

FInteractiveProcess - launch, run, stop, exit/quit/cancel, communicate with other processes

FMonitoredProcess - Convenience class for launching/monitoring processes. Event delegates for cancellation, completion, and output

**Note: To use these in code, you use the typedef that doesn't have generic. Ex: FPlatformMisc instead of FGenericPlatformMisc. FPlatformMisc is typedef'ed to the current platform (e.g. FWindowsPlatformMisc)**
