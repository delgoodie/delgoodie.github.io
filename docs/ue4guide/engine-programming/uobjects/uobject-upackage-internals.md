All unreal objects have unique path in the form of string:

/Game/MyGame/MyAsset.Myasset.ASubObjectOfMyAsset.AnotherObject

If you split the path using dot as delimiter you will get:

1. /Game/MyGame/MyAsset

1. MyAsset

1. ASubObjectOfMyAsset

1. AnotherObject

**Outer most object is awlays a UPackage**
- In this example, it's /Game/MyGame/MyAsset

**Object flags: Tell us the state of the object**
- RF_Public => this object is visible outside of its package
  - Example of non-public object is a sub-object
  - Every object you can see in editor is Public
- RF_Standalone => Doesnâ€™t need to be referenced to not be garbage collected
  - If containing package gets unloaded, then it gets GC'ed
- RF_Transactional => property changes are recorded and can be reverted

**Class flags: tell about the object's UClass**
- CLASS_Abstract => Class can't be instantiated
- CLASS_Native => Native class
- CLASS_Constructed

**All native classes get populated in /Script/\[ModuleName]**

**Native classes do not get a PostLoad**

**Constructor:**
- Object is still abstract entity

**PostInitProperties:**
- Properties initialized, including any set from config inis
- **NOTE:** Any properties set on default subobjects inside the constructor get stomped by the CDO's properties when the constructor exits
  - So this is good place to put "per instance" constructor initialization data
  - Ex: Initializing transient data that (e.g. CurrentOwner) that would be null on the CDO
- Ready to interact with the world

**Serialized Assets get PostLoad**
- PostLoad is where default properties that are changed in the editor get loaded into the object
- The reset to default yellow arrow simply applies the property's value from the CDO back into the current objects' property
