/**
 * Tests if a type T is bitwise-constructible from a given argument type U.  That is, whether or not
 * the U can be memcpy'd in order to produce an instance of T, rather than having to go
 * via a constructor.
 *
 * Examples:
 * TIsBitwiseConstructible<PODType,    PODType   >::Value == true  // PODs can be trivially copied
 * TIsBitwiseConstructible<const int*, int*      >::Value == true  // a non-const Derived pointer is trivially copyable as a const Base pointer
 * TIsBitwiseConstructible<int*,       const int*>::Value == false // not legal the other way because it would be a const-correctness violation
 * TIsBitwiseConstructible<int32,      uint32    >::Value == true  // signed integers can be memcpy'd as unsigned integers
 * TIsBitwiseConstructible<uint32,     int32     >::Value == true  // and vice versa
