Make sure to override cooking process somehow so that any lazily referenced objects in your new asset are added to the cook & inclusion process

Look at UDataTable::Serialize() & UWorld::AddReferencedObjects &

UWorld::PreSaveRoot(const TCHAR\* **Filename**, TArray<FString>& **AdditionalPackagesToCook**)

virtual void CookAdditionalFiles( const TCHAR* PackageFilename, const ITargetPlatform* TargetPlatform ) { }
```
