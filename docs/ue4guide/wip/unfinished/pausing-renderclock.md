Pausing RenderClock:

GPauseRenderingRealtimeClock controlled in UGameEngine.Tick.

- Can be paused using SetGamePaused

- Uses fixeddelta time correctly

- But always ticks even when Gworld->IsPaused() == true

- Ticking occurs based on GPauseRenderingRealtimeClock

- Only way it's ever turned off in Engine is through console cmd: PAUSERENDERCLOCK

  - HandlePauseRenderClockCommand( Cmd, Ar );

  - Sets GPauseRenderingRealtimeClock = !GPauseRenderingRealtimeClock;

Render Thread pausing

- Can be paused with helper class FSuspendRenderingThread (called from Game Thread)

  - Flushes Render Commands

  - Can call StopRenderingThread()/StartRenderingThread()

    - These functions atomically alter GIsRenderingThreadSuspended

    - Also can alter GRunRenderingThreadHeartbeat which happens on start/stopping the thread. If FSuspendRenderingThread is called to suspend by recreating the render thread, it will destroy the render thread & recreate it so it will set GRunRenderingThreadHeartbeat = false through StopRenderingThread

    - GIsRenderingThreadSuspended is used by FRenderingThreadTickHeartbeat (a separate GameThread to manage heartbeat ticks)

      - Heartbeat tick @ GRenderingThreadMaxIdleTickFrequency from GameThread

      - It ticks FTickableObjectRenderThread objects by enqueing TickingRenderingTickables() on the rendering thread (when GIsRenderingThreadSuspended == false)

      - This thread runs on it's own heartbeat which is disjoint from the GT or the other RT resources

      - It's Tick DeltaSeconds is in system real time, not game time or fixed time
