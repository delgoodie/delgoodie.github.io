### **TLDR:**

gafferongames \[10:59 PM]

Update: Don't go above 1200

1500 is \*ethernet\* MTU

IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280.

If you want to be conservative, 1200.

This lines up with most games I've worked on. They don't go above this.

\*practically\* both windows and mac set MTU 1500...

but be conservative. 1200.

noob question

\[4:45]

if our mtu is 512 bytes (minus headers) for sending packets over the internet (edited)

\[4:48]

and I want to send a snapshot that's 1024 bytes

\[4:48]

I presume I have to manually break that apart and re-assemble?

\[4:48]

and then worry about dropped packets?

###### gafferongames \[5:02 PM]

512 is too conservative

\[5:02]

You can send up to 1400 byte packets.

\[5:02]

I have code for fragmentation and reassemble you can use, and an article about it.

\[5:02]

There is easy to use example source code that comes with it. I'll upload it here for you

###### ikrima \[5:02 PM]

Yeah, I saw that but wanted to keep it super simple

###### gafferongames \[5:02 PM]

Oh this is the super simple version :wink:

###### ikrima \[5:02 PM]

really? I can use 1400 over IP4?

###### gafferongames \[5:02 PM]

yes

\[5:02]

well, 1k

\[5:03]

1100

###### ikrima \[5:03 PM]

haha, remember, I only play a network guy on tv

###### gafferongames \[5:03 PM]

but for all practical purposes these guys

\[5:03]

these days, MTU is 1500

###### ikrima \[5:03 PM]

nice

###### gafferongames \[5:03 PM]

subtract headers from that... be conservative. 1400

\[5:03]

1500 is the IPv6 minimum fragmentation

\[5:03]

so both windows an mac have that as a limit.

###### ikrima \[5:03 PM]

awesome

###### gafferongames \[5:03 PM]

from memory, ps4 and other platfroms may have smaller max

\[5:03]

eg. more like 1k, because they are more conservative, and wrap the packets on PSN with their own headers and shit.

\[5:03]

but thats' not relevant if you have dedicated servers.

###### ikrima \[5:03 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:03 PM]

only if p2p.

###### ikrima \[5:04 PM]

really?

###### gafferongames \[5:04 PM]

yep.

###### ikrima \[5:04 PM]

i thought MTU was on recieve as well?

###### gafferongames \[5:04 PM]

nonono

\[5:04]

i mean...

\[5:04]

you only need to use np signalling layer (eg. special "PS4 packets") if you are p2p

###### ikrima \[5:04 PM]

ah

###### gafferongames \[5:04 PM]

otherwise you just open up a udp socket and do whatever you want.

\[5:04]

ps. I'm working on a new project

\[5:04]

it's called "netcode.io"

\[5:05]

I'm aiming to make a minimal networking layer that does the security/auth of yojimbo

\[5:05]

but minus all the hardcore c++-ism

\[5:05]

my play is to standardize it

\[5:05]

and get it \*in browsers\*

\[5:05]

for games like agar.io

\[5:05]

I think it can be really big. It's a replacement for WebRTC

###### ikrima \[5:05 PM]

nice, i saw the thread on twitter/ the channel

###### gafferongames \[5:05 PM]

with just the cool connect token stuff yojimbo does

\[5:05]

but stripped out so it's pure C

\[5:05]

and highly portable to other languages

\[5:05]

it sends 1400 byte packets :slightly_smiling_face:

\[5:06]

so there is your answer :wink:

###### ikrima \[5:06 PM]

so, i feel like i'm missing something here

###### gafferongames \[5:06 PM]

(it will not do MTU, MTU would need to be done on top of it...)

###### ikrima \[5:06 PM]

b/c this networking protocol i'm landing on seems dead simple

###### gafferongames \[5:06 PM]

you are probably missing something

###### ikrima \[5:06 PM]

and now I'm like ok, why is everyone not doing this

\[5:06]

if I can send 1k every frame, I can snapshot the entire gamestate

###### gafferongames \[5:06 PM]

sure

###### ikrima \[5:07 PM]

and send up to 1/3 of a second back of frame data

\[5:07]

and really not care about floating point determinism

\[5:07]

b/c I can send quantized quaternions & position

###### gafferongames \[5:07 PM]

I don't really understand what you mean by this:

\[5:07]

"and send up to 1/3 of a second back of frame data"

###### ikrima \[5:07 PM]

....

###### gafferongames \[5:07 PM]

do you mean, combat packet loss with redundancy?

###### ikrima \[5:07 PM]

and then profit

\[5:07]

ah, sorry, i mean game frame data

\[5:07]

like 10 frames of game state at 30 fps

###### gafferongames \[5:08 PM]

what you are missing

\[5:08]

is that most connections can't reliably receive much more than 256kbit/sec

\[5:08]

and maybe 512kbit/sec at most.

\[5:08]

because it's not just you on that line.

###### ikrima \[5:08 PM]

wait wtf

###### gafferongames \[5:08 PM]

also, if you are hosting dedicated servers

\[5:08]

you are forgetting that you pay for bandwidth in and out of data center.

###### ikrima \[5:09 PM]

right, cost definitely

###### gafferongames \[5:09 PM]

this is what you are missing.

\[5:09]

secondly, you haven't addressed how latency hiding will be implemented.

###### ikrima \[5:09 PM]

but people can't recieve more than 256k still???

###### gafferongames \[5:09 PM]

and security concerns.

\[5:09]

yes, i'll give you some ballparks...

\[5:09]

titanfall 2 worked very hard to send 256kbit/sec or less.

\[5:09]

in fact in common case I send just 100kbit/sec.

\[5:09]

this is large snapshots, but those snapshots are at 20HZ

\[5:09]

titanfall 1 was less optimized.

###### ikrima \[5:09 PM]

god dammit

###### gafferongames \[5:09 PM]

it sent up to 256kbit/sec and sometimes spiked to 512

\[5:10]

i optimized all this, and its send rate was 10HZ

\[5:10]

this is the work that I did at titanfall that took me 2 years

\[5:10]

that's all i did for 2 years.

\[5:10]

more recent games, large ones...

\[5:10]

i think has started pushing the boundary at 512kbit

\[5:10]

like battlefront 4

\[5:10]

i would not go above that, or a sizable % will have a bad experience.

\[5:10]

as a rule, don't ever take more than 50% of available bandwidth.

\[5:10]

and since peoples till have 1mbit...

\[5:10]

ideally, don't take more than 25% :slightly_smiling_face:

###### ikrima \[5:11 PM]

gotcha

###### gafferongames \[5:11 PM]

you need SAFETY

\[5:11]

less bandwidth you use, more likely packets will be delivered timely.

\[5:11]

timely is what you want.

\[5:11]

not throughput.

\[5:11]

ps. titanfall 2 plays a lot better than tf1 for this reason, and with 20HZ send rate.

\[5:11]

so this is why netowrking is hard.

\[5:11]

bandwidth is still limited.

\[5:11]

latency still exists.

\[5:11]

security still a problem.

\[5:11]

give it 2 years, i think games will start sending 1mbit down.

\[5:12]

ps. its even more dire for upload bandwidth

###### ikrima \[5:12 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:12 PM]

would not go over 64kbit for that.

\[5:12]

128 at most.

###### ikrima \[5:12 PM]

so if i do 1k/s at 30hz

###### gafferongames \[5:12 PM]

yeahh... do the math

\[5:12]

also

###### ikrima \[5:12 PM]

that's still under 256kbits

###### gafferongames \[5:12 PM]

consider packet headers are there

###### ikrima \[5:12 PM]

but now I have to force everything else in there

###### gafferongames \[5:12 PM]

so 32 byte \* 30 HZ

\[5:12]

conservative.

\[5:12]

higher for ipv6.

\[5:13]

hey, i got god of war ascension under 64kbit/sec common case, made it play better. :slightly_smiling_face:

\[5:13]

at 60HZ packet send rate.

\[5:13]

those packets were tiny. nothing.

\[5:13]

these days, you guys have it easy :wink:

###### ikrima \[5:13 PM]

haha

###### gafferongames \[5:13 PM]

ps. the trick for reducing bandwidth is delta compression

\[5:14]

I can teach you that when I get back into LA

\[5:14]

give me half a day on a whiteboar with you, i can show you exactly how its done

###### ikrima \[5:14 PM]

Yeah, I saw the delta encoder stuff; looks very interesting and good for V2

\[5:14]

:P

###### gafferongames \[5:14 PM]

bottom line: snapshot stuff @ 30HZ

\[5:14]

don't worry about size.

\[5:14]

MTU split those guys as per-my article

\[5:14]

delta encode later.

yup

\[5:14]

ok, great

\[5:14]

this really helps wrangle the floating point determinism with GGPO

###### gafferongames \[5:15 PM]

well, you don't need determinism

\[5:15]

if you are sending the whole state.

###### ikrima \[5:15 PM]

exactly

###### gafferongames \[5:15 PM]

ps. you are just reinventing fps network model here

\[5:15]

except you are doing it, valve/quake style with snapshots

###### ikrima \[5:15 PM]

yup

###### gafferongames \[5:15 PM]

instead of the unreal way, where they don't delta encode, and they send partial world updates per-packet

###### ikrima \[5:16 PM]

which GGPO is pretty much a derivative of

###### gafferongames \[5:16 PM]

mmmm kindof.

###### ikrima \[5:16 PM]

except with some interesting insights for how it applies to fighting games

###### gafferongames \[5:16 PM]

there is definitely similarities in the rollback for GGPO and the fps rewind and replay.

\[5:16]

but everything else is different.

###### ikrima \[5:16 PM]

oh, must be missing something then

###### gafferongames \[5:16 PM]

probably.

###### ikrima \[5:16 PM]

I thought that was the key quake model. I haven't gone back over that in a while

###### gafferongames \[5:16 PM]

nope.

\[5:17]

GGPO rollback is a different style to fps.

\[5:17]

same concept...

###### ikrima \[5:17 PM]

but the key for me for GGPO was rewind+replay+snapshot

###### gafferongames \[5:17 PM]

different implementation, since no state ever sent.

\[5:17]

no.

\[5:17]

GGPO doesn't ever send snapshots.

\[5:17]

that's where you are confusing it.

###### ikrima \[5:17 PM]

except GGPO uses floating point determinism to imply state snapshots

###### gafferongames \[5:17 PM]

GGPO = perfect determinism, no snapshots.

###### ikrima \[5:17 PM]

b/c it sends controller snapshot state

###### gafferongames \[5:17 PM]

kindof.

\[5:17]

remember when I told you about two sims?

\[5:17]

GGPO copies world state, (fork)

\[5:17]

and sims that with local inputs up to present time

\[5:18]

throws it away next time inputs come in from server,

\[5:18]

forks again, resims to present time with local inputs.

\[5:18]

FPS games don't do the forking step.

\[5:18]

you have to fork with GGPO because you have no concept of state coming from server.

\[5:18]

all you have is inputs coming from server, so otherwise you can't "snap back" to the old server state.

\[5:18]

it's a subtle point, but the two are very different in implentation.

\[5:19]

for example, FPS games don't have a concept of, OK now take the whole game state and copy it from A->B, now similate copy B forward.

###### ikrima \[5:19 PM]

right right, the prediction correction is different

###### gafferongames \[5:19 PM]

it's a crazy per-object thing, since only the client controlled objects are rolled back and resimulated.

\[5:19]

same concept, different impl.

###### ikrima \[5:19 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:19 PM]

fps is, rollback local client controlled objects \*only\*

\[5:19]

rest of world is in past

###### ikrima \[5:19 PM]

for ggpo, we fork and blit the gamestate into backupbuffers

\[5:19]

ah

###### gafferongames \[5:19 PM]

ggpo is roll back whole world...

\[5:20]

to a saved definitive state, representing most recent inputs from server.

\[5:20]

predict that ahad with local inputs.

###### ikrima \[5:20 PM]

right right, forgot about that with the FPS model

###### gafferongames \[5:20 PM]

throw that away

\[5:20]

resimulated next input comes in from server.

\[5:20]

rinse repeat.

\[5:20]

OK i think you have it.

###### ikrima \[5:20 PM]

and for us, we're basically snapshotting the entire world over the network

###### gafferongames \[5:20 PM]

yes.

###### ikrima \[5:20 PM]

b/c we can

###### gafferongames \[5:20 PM]

and this is excatly what FPS games do

\[5:20]

as well...

\[5:20]

the good ones.

\[5:20]

(not unreal)

###### ikrima \[5:20 PM]

haha

###### gafferongames \[5:21 PM]

unreal is dumb. they think, sending partial state update is important

\[5:21]

so subset of world only per-packet.

\[5:21]

much smarter to include all world state in packet for all objects.

\[5:21]

simpler.

###### ikrima \[5:21 PM]

yeah it's horrible

###### gafferongames \[5:21 PM]

unreal is utter garbage networking

\[5:21]

i've told sweeney this himself but he doesn't understand.

\[5:21]

thinks its not possible to do any other way. he's wrong.

\[5:21]

the secret sauce is the delta compression

\[5:21]

that's where unreal breaks down, and quake/unreal wins.

\[5:22]

also, extrapolation bad

\[5:22]

interpolation good.

###### ikrima \[5:22 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:22 PM]

unreal extrapolates remote view of objects

\[5:22]

cod/titanfall interpolates.

\[5:22]

consider, you probably need to, because packets don't arrive nicely spaced out

\[5:22]

buffer packets on client for 50-100ms before displaying.

\[5:22]

just be aware of this. you may not be right now.

###### ikrima \[5:22 PM]

?

###### gafferongames \[5:22 PM]

this is another gotcha.

\[5:23]

well, if i sent a packet 30HZ

\[5:23]

do you think it is received 30HZ on the other side?

\[5:23]

of course not.

###### ikrima \[5:23 PM]

i thought GGPO extrapolated

###### gafferongames \[5:23 PM]

1-2-0-1-1-2-0

\[5:23]

GGPO is different.

###### ikrima \[5:23 PM]

that was the whole insight

###### gafferongames \[5:23 PM]

i'm talking FPS now.

###### ikrima \[5:23 PM]

oh right

###### gafferongames \[5:23 PM]

forget GGPO it's not for you.

###### ikrima \[5:23 PM]

yeah, but for us we won't need to

###### gafferongames \[5:23 PM]

it's a dead end.

###### ikrima \[5:23 PM]

lol wut

\[5:24]

That's the whole scheme I was describing?

###### gafferongames \[5:24 PM]

nonon :wink:

\[5:24]

GGPO is deterministic lockstep

###### ikrima \[5:24 PM]

GGPO except sending whole world snapshots

###### gafferongames \[5:24 PM]

you are not deterministic lockstep

\[5:24]

you are not GGPo

\[5:24]

you don't have the same characteristics.

###### ikrima \[5:24 PM]

ok, GGPO prime then

###### gafferongames \[5:24 PM]

what you are describing to me is more like fps network model.

\[5:24]

here is the key benefit of GGPO

\[5:24]

because it never sends state

\[5:25]

it can be made secure even on PC sku, p2p with no server.

\[5:25]

problem of it: low palyer counts, lag switches really effective.

\[5:25]

what you are describing doesn't have these characteristic.

\[5:25]

you send state, so no longer secure p2p.

\[5:25]

you don't wait for inputs, so no longer lag switch problematic.

###### ikrima \[5:25 PM]

oh, i was planning on waiting for inputs

###### gafferongames \[5:25 PM]

oh. but why?

\[5:26]

you don't need them :slightly_smiling_face:

\[5:26]

you are sending state

\[5:26]

ok so your main choice now is...

\[5:26]

do you buffer and interpolate between snapshots, adding latency.

\[5:26]

or do you snap state hard, and extrapolate with last input.

###### ikrima \[5:26 PM]

snap hard with extrapolate last input

###### gafferongames \[5:26 PM]

either way, you are going to need some buffering, because packets don't come in every frame

\[5:26]

so you'll miss inputs that way.

\[5:26]

inputs are at 90HZ

###### ikrima \[5:27 PM]

we process input only at 30hz

###### gafferongames \[5:27 PM]

(unless your game sims at 30 and renders 90HZ)

###### ikrima \[5:27 PM]

sim at 30, render at 30, 60, 90, or 120

###### gafferongames \[5:27 PM]

ok good. then you'll miss inputs on packet loss unless you send them redundant.

\[5:27]

you'll need at least, a few frames of buffer safety for inputs, otherwise you'll miss

###### ikrima \[5:27 PM]

gotcha

###### gafferongames \[5:27 PM]

but yeah, if you block hard on inputs, you'll have GGPO like characteristics.

\[5:28]

but without any security if p2p.

###### ikrima \[5:28 PM]

dedis for that

###### gafferongames \[5:28 PM]

ok, so now you are client side predicting.

###### ikrima \[5:28 PM]

:money_with_wings::money_with_wings::money_with_wings::money_with_wings:

\[5:28]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:28 PM]

you better not be cpu bound.

\[5:28]

because you will roll back whole world

###### ikrima \[5:28 PM]

that's my only worry

\[5:28]

which we're generally not b/c of VR

###### gafferongames \[5:28 PM]

not just the local player, is that your plan?

###### ikrima \[5:28 PM]

right

\[5:28]

the whole world

###### gafferongames \[5:29 PM]

ok give it a go

\[5:29]

but consider this...

\[5:29]

what the client sees

\[5:29]

is a ghost

\[5:29]

with dedis.

\[5:29]

and with GGPO

\[5:29]

so some input delay will be required, otherwise you'll get too much rubberbanding and rollback

###### ikrima \[5:29 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:29 PM]

just like SF

\[5:29]

sounds reasonable.

\[5:29]

give it a go.

###### ikrima \[5:30 PM]

sweet

###### gafferongames \[5:30 PM]

my prediction: as player counts increase, you'll be waiting for most recent input for players more often

\[5:30]

also, you are delayed as per-most lagged player

###### ikrima \[5:30 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:30 PM]

so it does inherit the bad aspects of GGPO

###### ikrima \[5:30 PM]

which i really hate

###### gafferongames \[5:30 PM]

and potentially, the low player count restriction

###### ikrima \[5:30 PM]

but it's a compromise i have to make

###### gafferongames \[5:30 PM]

yes.

###### ikrima \[5:30 PM]

and then player counts are just going to be 2

###### gafferongames \[5:30 PM]

fallback: try this, if you don't like it

###### ikrima \[5:30 PM]

well 3 if you count server

###### gafferongames \[5:30 PM]

go fps model. with some input delay

\[5:31]

rollback only the local player, but hold rest of the world some amount of time in the past

\[5:31]

and show a kill replay that resolves how/why you died, from POV of attacker.

\[5:31]

this is how COD does it.

###### ikrima \[5:31 PM]

interesting

###### gafferongames \[5:31 PM]

that's just fps network model, rebranded for your concept.

\[5:31]

in this model, you wouldn't wait for inputs.

\[5:31]

so could scale to higher player counts.

###### ikrima \[5:31 PM]

but i can't imagine melee not sucking

###### gafferongames \[5:31 PM]

but you'd have more delay viewing other player actions.

\[5:32]

agreed, but it is what it is.

\[5:32]

no need to tilt at windmills.

###### ikrima \[5:32 PM]

heh, right

\[5:32]

I'll attempt the GGPO-esque scheme

###### gafferongames \[5:32 PM]

sure sounds good. give it a go.

\[5:32]

you'll learn something, at minimum.

###### ikrima \[5:32 PM]

if that starts sucking, i'll add massive knockback to each attack and go with FPS

###### gafferongames \[5:32 PM]

yeah

###### ikrima \[5:32 PM]

so that you can't melee combo easily

###### gafferongames \[5:32 PM]

fps will only start to break down with parry/block/chains

\[5:32]

its the combos that will break down.

\[5:33]

you'll notice all fps melee is basically, melee = you dead.

\[5:33]

this is why.

###### ikrima \[5:33 PM]

right

###### gafferongames \[5:33 PM]

of course, nobody would ever add input delay to fps to combat the rollback

\[5:33]

so you have that up your sleeve.

\[5:33]

ps. input delay must be on both movement and attacking, ... all actions.

###### ikrima \[5:33 PM]

yeah definitely

###### gafferongames \[5:34 PM]

and you should definitely consider,

\[5:34]

limiting speed.

###### ikrima \[5:34 PM]

our game is definitely slow

###### gafferongames \[5:34 PM]

consider, in typical round trip, how far can player move?

\[5:34]

this is why fps breaks down... fast movement

###### ikrima \[5:34 PM]

on purpose

###### gafferongames \[5:34 PM]

melee attack a fast moving guy...

###### ikrima \[5:34 PM]

every attack has 100 ms windup

###### gafferongames \[5:34 PM]

= no way is your attack hitting.

\[5:34]

well, input delay doesn't mean windup

\[5:34]

it means, actual delay on inputs.

\[5:34]

before your sim sees them.

###### ikrima \[5:34 PM]

no i know

\[5:34]

but the windup reduces speed

###### gafferongames \[5:34 PM]

but windup = good.

###### ikrima \[5:34 PM]

and how fast you can move

###### gafferongames \[5:35 PM]

anything that commits somebody on an attack = good.

\[5:35]

ok. you have this in hand. go for it.

###### ikrima \[5:35 PM]

awesome; thanks for this

###### gafferongames \[5:35 PM]

:thumbsup:

\[5:35]

no worries mate

###### ikrima \[5:35 PM]

I now only feel slightly insane for attempting (edited)

###### gafferongames \[5:35 PM]

nah you're doing the right approach

\[5:35]

have a plan, have a backup.

\[5:35]

i'm still worried about your dedi cost.

\[5:35]

ps. the stuff i'm doing for netcode.io will help you run dedis.

\[5:35]

securely.

###### ikrima \[5:35 PM]

excellent

\[5:35]

so am I

###### gafferongames \[5:36 PM]

and it is policy free, so can be grabbed and integrated easily.

###### ikrima \[5:36 PM]

but, it's only a problem if we have large player counts. THen we can throw engineering talent at the issue

###### gafferongames \[5:36 PM]

sure.

\[5:36]

ok have to run. you got this. go get em

###### ikrima \[5:36 PM]

:+1:

###### gafferongames \[10:59 PM]

Update: Don't go above 1200

\[10:59]

1500 is \*ethernet\* MTU

\[10:59]

IPv6 minimum MTU is 1280.

\[10:59]

If you want to be conservative, 1200.

\[11:00]

This lines up with most games I've worked on. They don't go above this.

\[11:00]

\*practically\* both windows and mac set MTU 1500...

\[11:00]

but be conservative. 1200.
