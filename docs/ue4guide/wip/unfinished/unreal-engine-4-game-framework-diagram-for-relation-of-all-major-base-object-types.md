[Everything you should know about replication]

*From &lt;<https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?43714-Multicast-not-showing-on-Server>>*

Useful Debug Commands:

- Look at class ENGINE_API UCheatManager : public Uobject in CheatManager.h

- 'ToggleDebugCamera'

- showdebug bones

Physics Replication:

Handling replication for an actor that is simulating physics on the client side is done in OnRep_ReplicatedMovement() in /Engine/Source/Runtime/Engine/Private/ActorReplication.cpp. If you follow the chain you'll see the actual adjustments are done in ApplyRigidBodyState() in PrimitiveComponentPhysics.cpp. If you want to see how the server replicates the Actor's properties take a look at ServerReplicateActors() in NetworkDriver.cpp and its call to ReplicateActor() in DataChannel.cpp.
