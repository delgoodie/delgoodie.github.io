Oculus Rift Coordinate System:

- Device Position is in the reference frame of the rift defined by the recalibration. So wherever you are looking IRL when you reset the HMD, that will be +X, right of that will be +Y, above that will be +Z.

- Device Rotation will be relative to the recalibration although only Yaw gets reset during recalibration
