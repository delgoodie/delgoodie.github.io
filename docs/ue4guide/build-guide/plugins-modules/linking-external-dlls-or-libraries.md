All In One Sample on a Plugin that builds its own Third Party Lib:
<https://github.com/ue4plugins/MotionCueingInterface>

Dynamic DLL
<https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Linking_Dlls>

Plugins Overview & Third Party Overview:
<https://www.slideshare.net/GerkeMaxPreussner/plugins-thirdparty-sdks-in-ue4>

Add header only (no dll/lib) third party stuff:

- Have to make a module (look at SDL2.build.cs or Leap.Build.cs)

PublicDelayLoadDLLs.Add("opencv_calib3d2410d.dll");
PublicAdditionalLibraries.Add("opencv_video2410d.lib");

**NOTE: IF YOU NEED TO JUST LINK AGAINST AN EXTERNAL SET OF HEADER FILES, USE** PrivateIncludePathModuleNames OR PublicIncludePathModuleNames.

**IF A HEADER NEEDS TO INCLUDE EXTERNAL HEADER AND THE HEADER IS IN A PUBLIC FOLDER, YOU HAVE TO USE** PublicIncludePathModuleNames

### Notes:

##### Module Types

•Developer – for development only
•Editor – for Unreal Editor only
•Runtime – for anything
•Programs – for standalone programs
•Third Party – for external code & libs
*Note: The UE4 EULA prohibits inclusion of Editor modules in shipping games*

**Structure of Modules**

- Private folder
- Internal implementation
- Module initialization
- Pre-compiled header
- Public folder
- Interfaces
- Exported Types
- Build.cs file

Https

PrivateIncludePaths

- Sub-folders inside your module’s Private folder

PublicIncludePaths

- Sub-folders inside your module’s Public folder (not needed)

PrivateIncludePathModuleNames

- Modules whose public headers your module’s private implementation includes, but doesn’t link to PublicIncludePathModuleNames

- Modules whose public headers your module’s public interface includes, but doesn’t link to

PrivateDependencyModuleNames

- Modules that your module’s private implementation requires for compiling and linking

PublicDependencyModuleNames

- Modules that your module’s public interface requires for compiling and linking DynamicallyLoadedModuleNames


- Modules that are loaded at run-time via ModuleManager (this is to ensure that they get compiled)

More options in RulesCompiler.cs

PublicLibraryPaths

- Paths to folders containing additional libraries

PublicAdditionalLibraries

- Additional libraries (.lib or .a files) to link against

PublicFrameworks

- Additional XCode frameworks (iOS, macOS only)

PublicWeakFrameworks

- Weak frameworks (for OS transition)

PublicAdditionalShadowFiles

- Files that need to be copied for remote compilation

RuntimeDependencies

- Runtime dependencies to be staged for a packaged build

Structure of Plug-ins

- One or more modules


- Plug-in descriptor


- Content (optional)


- Resources (optional)
  - Plug-in Descriptor
  - Json file {PluginName.uplugin}
  - Inside root of plug-in directory
    - Contains:
      - Version information
      - User friendly description
      - Module loading rules

**Third-Party Libraries**

Structure of Engine Dependencies

•Located in /Engine/Source/ThirdParty

•Each has its own Build.cs file

 • Just like any other module

 • Public includes (for headers to be

 compiled into dependent modules)

 • Public libraries (for libraries to be

 linked into dependent modules)

 • Optional pre-processor definitions

Building Engine Dependencies

•Source code is often included, but…

• We provide pre-compiled libs for everything

• UBT never compiles them when building your projects

•Internally, we pre-compile the libraries using…

 • BuildThirdPartyLibs UAT script (automated)

 • Batch files and shell scripts (manual)

 • Specialized UAT scripts (i.e. for PhysX)

•Sometimes there are text files with instructions

Structure of Plug-in Dependencies

 •Same as Engine third-party dependencies

 •Same build rules
