## Approach 1: AutoRuns

- TLDR: use **_SysInternals: AutoRuns_** to find bad behaving/suspect drivers [(Reference)](https://www.overclock.net/threads/official-amd-ryzen-ddr4-24-7-memory-stability-thread.1628751/page-1041)
  - Configuration
    
    - **_Options->Hide Microsoft Entries:_** enable this and unhide everything else
    - **_Options->Scan Options->Verify code signatures:_** enable
    - **_Options->Scan Options->Check VirusTotal.com:_** optional; useful but lots of false positives
  - Key Points
    
    - `Red`:    no digital signature. if _"LargeCorp"_ driver, **_extremely suspect/dangers_** (failed/didn't care to pass WHL Quality Assurance); if _open-source_ driver, likely won't be signed bc of cost
    - `Yellow`: driver image not found; usually safe to remove
    - Most Important Categories: 'Drivers','Services','ScheduledTasks','Logon'
  - **_Drivers_**: most difficult bc Windows often can't remove kernel/device driver, marks it for deletion at reboot, which often silently fails

     > |Driver|Problems|
     > |------|--------|
     > |`AMDRyzenMasterDriverV*`|seems latest versions are less dangerous and gets uninstalled, anyway better to remove RM unless you have gun pointed at your head|
     > |`AsrDrv*`|ASRock drivers, anything ASRock should be removed; literally banned as it provides [full kernel access](https://github.com/stong/CVE-2020-15368)|
     > |`Asusgio2`|anything ASUS should be removed, the worst. If you have ROG peripherals you may need to keep the ROG drivers. Armoury-Crate software is a virus-like, will cause BSOD and all sort of issues, stay away|
     > |`EneIo`,`EneTechIo`,`*Io64.sys`|RGB software drivers usually terrible written, suffering from performance **and** serious security holes|
     > |`gdrv`,`gdrv2`|GigaByte software, 2nd worse after ASUS, remove everything. Known to cause BSODs|
     > |`NTIOLib_MSISimple_OC`,`NTIOLib_OCKit`,`MSI Command Center`|not the worst but hitting performances. Remove all MSI software, you can do the same without usually. Nice to change options without rebooting but then once done disable the driver|
     > |`NPF*`,`Network Packet Filter drivers`|used by many network utils (e.g. PowerLine adapters, etc) so must check if needed; can always disable/re-enable on-demand instead of deleting|
     > |`AMDRyzenMasterDriverV*`|seems latest versions are less dangerous and gets uninstalled, anyway better to remove RM unless you have gun pointed at your head|
     > |`AsrDrv*`|ASRock drivers, anything ASRock should be removed; literally banned as it provides [full kernel access](https://github.com/stong/CVE-2020-15368)|
     > |`Asusgio2`|anything ASUS should be removed, the worst. If you have ROG peripherals you may need to keep the ROG drivers. Armoury-Crate software is a virus-like, will cause BSOD and all sort of issues, stay away|
     > |`EneIo`,`EneTechIo`,`*Io64.sys`|RGB software drivers usually terrible written, suffering from performance **and** serious security holes|
     > |`gdrv`,`gdrv2`|GigaByte software, 2nd worse after ASUS, remove everything. Known to cause BSODs|

    - Application Drivers: usually fine since they should only be loaded on demand on app start (e.g. CPU-z,HWInfo,GPU-z,)
    - HW drivers: dangerous as can  can cause your system to stop booting; always use system snapshots
  - **_Services_**: pretty easy bc easily discoverable/traceable
    
     > 
     > \[!warning\]\- Usual Suspects/Bad Offenders
     > 
     > |Driver|Problems|
     > |------|--------|
     > |HW peripheral vendors|install superflous services e.g. [RazerGameService](https://scorpiosoftware.net/2022/05/14/zombie-processes/)|
     > |anti-cheat from games||
     > |'Automatic','DelayedStart' 3rd-party services|if service is for disabled/on-demand feature, requiring always-on background execution is sign of lurking issues (process likely running 'sleep mode' causing perf issues, micro-stuttering, zombie kernel objects/child processes). workaround by setting to 'Disabled' or `Manual`|
  
  - **_ScheduledTasks_**: tricky b/c big troubleshooting headache
    
    - usually disabling works in short-to-midterm but breaks in mid-to-longterm (e.g. update requires Task but upgrade didn't re-enable Task)
    - root cause analysis is headache b/c likely won't remember manually disabling task
    - then relying on dice roll of how robust app's logging is but if you had to disable the task manually, app was probably poorly written to begin with
    - safest to disable tasks for uninstalled software
  - **_Logon_**: subtle footguns abound
    
    - safest to mainly disable uninstalled/'yellow' registry keys
    - then use another tool to disable startups e.g.
      - [NirSoft WhatInStartup](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/what_run_in_startup.html)
      - [SystemInformer](https://systeminformer.sourceforge.io)
      - TaskManager/msconfig

## Approach 2: SCManager

`sc.exe`: **Service Control Manager CLI** to manipulate services; drivers run as special kernel service

- TLDR: attempt forensics on driver with `sc`
  
  - query driver to glean useful info
    ```batch
    sc queryex        ssgdio
    sc qc             ssgdio
    sc qdescription   ssgdio
    sc GetDisplayName ssgdio
    sc GetKeyName     ssgdio
    sc EnumDepend     ssgdio
    ```
  
  - disable service and reboot
    ```batch
    sc stop   ssgdio
    sc config ssgdio start= disabled
    [restart_machine]
    ```
  
  - delete driver
    ```batch
    sc delete ssgdio
    ```

- `sc` command details
  
  - `sc.exe`: Service Control Manager cli to manipulate services (drivers run as special kernel service)
    
    ```batch
    Syntax: sc <"\\ServerName"> [command] [service name] <option1> <option2>...
    Help:   sc [command]
    ```
  
  - Global Commands: operate on SCManager; does not take service name
    \| Command        | Description                                                                                        |
    \| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    \| `sc [command]` | get help for command                                                                               |
    \| `boot`         | `ok|bad` Indicates whether the last boot should be saved as the last-known-good boot configuration |
    \| `Lock`         | Locks the Service Database                                                                         |
    \| `QueryLock`    | Queries the LockStatus for the SCManager Database                                                  |

    \| Command           | Description                                                                                        |

## Approach 3: pnputil

- find bad offender's by looking at [zombie processes](https://scorpiosoftware.net/2022/05/14/zombie-processes/) using Pavel's Object Explorer
  - ex: Razer's shitty GameManagerService.exe that's forced on users for no reason
- list/inspect
  - AutoRuns
  - DriverView
  - DevManView
  - InstalledDriverList
  - command line
    ```batch
    driverquery /V
    pnputil /enum-drivers
    pnputil /enum-devices 
    pnputil /enum-interfaces
    ```

- delete
  - BCUninstaller
  - BleachBit
  - command line
    ```batch
    pnputil /delete-driver oem####.inf /uninstall /force
    ```
    
    ```powershell
    Get-CimInstance Win32_SystemDriver -Filter "name='LGBusEnum'" | Invoke-CimMethod -MethodName Delete
    Get-CimInstance Win32_SystemDriver -Filter "name='LGJoyXlCore'" | Invoke-CimMethod -MethodName Delete
    Get-CimInstance Win32_SystemDriver -Filter "name='LGVirHid'" | Invoke-CimMethod -MethodName Delete
    Get-CimInstance Win32_SystemDriver -Filter "name='LVRS64'" | Invoke-CimMethod -MethodName Delete
    ```
