# Programming Language Theory: Parsing

## Parsing/ASTs

- Different AST types
  - Homogenous: one type of node `class ASTNode`
  - Normalized Heterogenous: `class Expr : public ASTNode { vector<ASTNode*> children; };`
  - Irregular Heterogenous: named nodes `class BinaryExpr : public Expr { Expr* left, right; };`
- Tree walkers
  - Tree Grammar: use grammar to generate walkers
    - Forced visitation order
    - useful for when every subtree must be touched (like codegen)
  - Tree Pattern Matcher: specifies patterns we care about
    - different phases of application care about different parts of tree
    - decouples order we apply tree patterns from tree patterns themselves
    - useful for term re-writing (change multiply to simd multiply)
- Traversal orders
  - Preorder
  - In-order
  - Postorder

## Insights

- split Tokenizing from Parsing
- LR/LLR/etc is overcomplication. Just write parsers like normal code
