# Programming Language Theory: Basic Concepts

- **syntax:** form of programs i.e. arrangement of expressions, commands, declarations, and other constructs that constitute well-formed program
- **semantics:** meaning of programs: how a well-formed program may be expected to behave when executed on a computer
- **pragmatics:** intended way language to be used in practice
- **Front-end Phases**
  - **lexer: lexical analysis: text → tokens:** tokenize character stream into tokens
  - **parser: syntax analysis: tokens → CST:** build concrete syntax tree based on grammar from tokens
  - **semantic analyzer: semantic analysis: CST → IR:** build intermediate representation
    - **build AST:** reduce CST into abstract syntax tree
    - **annotate AST:** decorate AST with semantic attributes (e.g type, scope)
    - **static analysis:** enforce static language semantics
    - **create IR:** create intermediate representation, possibly annotated with dynamic semantics

## Language Constructs

- programs manipulate **symbols**, which are named **values** with a **type**, through operations expressed by **language semantics** using a **type system**
- the **language semantics** typically defined in a bottom-up fashion
  - values
  - identifiers
  - entities
    - variables
    - constants
    - types
  - expressions
  - statements
  - compound statements
  - methods
  - program

### Intrinsic/Meta Constructs

- **identifier:** a unique name within a given _environment context_
- **attribute:** semantic aspect
  - may be **static** (compile time determined) or **dynamic** (determined at execution time)
    ```cpp
    int x;
    type     := static
    value    := dynamic
    location := static if global variable, otherwise dynamic
    ```
  
  - some common attributes
    - _type attribute:_ type identifier of entity
    - _literal attribute:_ value that has no memory
    - _location attribute:_ address of storage cell in store
    - _visibility qualifier attribute:_ determines if a identifier can be reached outside of its scope (e.g. field/method names in C++)
      - also for variable shadowing precedence
      - qualifiers may be needed to make otherwise invisible names to be visible in a scope. Eg:
        - local var superceding global var
        - names in other packages
        - private members in classes
- **entity:** collection of **attributes** that define semantics of a language construct.
  - **entity category:** defines type of language entity i.e. set of attributes + supported operations
  - simple implementation treats entities as sumtypes with entity category as the sumtype tag
  - some common entities:
    - _constant entities:_ type attribute, value attribute
    - _variable entities:_ type attribute, location attribute
    - _function entities:_ signature attribute, implementation attribute
- **symbol:** identifier used as a typed reference to program entities minimally containing
  - analogue of pointers to values
    
    |analogue|pointer|symbol|
    |--------|-------|------|
    |semantic|reference to value|reference to program entity|
    |representation|64bit integer|string|
    |denotes|memory address|entity|
    |type|points to values of type T|points to entities of entity category C|
    |dereferencing|based on pointer type + runtime state e.g. memory address in heap, offset in stack frame, device handle, etc|based on _name binding_ + _environment context_|
    |using unbound instance behavior|pointer is uninit or null => null-deref/wild-pointer crash|symbol binding is not in scope => compilation error if static scoped language/runtime crash if dynamic scope|
  
  - **identifier attribute:** (possibly scope qualified) name of symbol
  
  - **entity category:** language entity tag implies set of attributes to expect

### Homoiconicity

- **homoiconic languages** require the language constructs to also be in the type system to be able to support "code as data" manipulations
  
  - **symbol table:** abstract data structure maintaining/mapping **symbol → entity** bindings
  - Example of Julia
    - [how julia is homoiconic?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31733766/in-what-sense-are-languages-like-elixir-and-julia-homoiconic/31734725#31734725)
    - [what is a julia symbol?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23480722/what-is-a-symbol-in-julia)

### Values/Types

- **value**: an abstraction of an entity that can be manipulated by a program
  - **first class citizen:** can be parameter, returned from method, and assigned to variable (ex: int type)
  - **second class citizen:** can be parameter, but not returned from method or assigned to variable
  - **third class citizen:** can't be parameter
- **type:** a set (in the math sense) of values with supported set of operations
  - **primitive types:** set of values that can't be decomposed into simpler values e.g. int, bool, char, symbol
  - **compound types:** constructed from other types using **type constructor expression**
    - **product types:** cartesian product of types
      - _untagged:_ tuple, components identified by index
      - _tagged:_ associated identifier with each component
    - **sum types:** set union of types
    - **function types:** T1 → T2 is a function type takes one argument of type T1 and returns type T2
    - **array types:** `array(elememtType,range)`
    - **pointer types:** `ptr(elementType)`
    - **recursive type:** defined in terms of itself
- **type system:** groups values into types
  - **statically typed:** each variable and expression has a fixed type (implying all operands can be type-checked at compile-time)
  - **dynamically typed:** values have fixed types, but variables & expressions have no fixed types
    - every time operand is computed could yield a value of a different type
    - operands must be type-checked after they are computed, but before performing the operation
  - **type equivalence:**
    - **Structural equivalence:** two types have same identical type expressions
      - array ranges usually not considered as part of the type
      - record labels are considered part of the type
    - **Name equivalence:** have the same identifier
    - **Declaration equivalence:** declarations lead back to the same original type expression by a series of redeclarations

### Expressions

- **expression:** a construct that will be evaluated to yield a value
  - **literals:** denotes a fixed value of some type
  - **constructions:** expression that constructs a composite value from its component values
  - **function calls:** computes a result by applying a method to one or more arguments
    - usually of form `F(E1,...,En)`: F => the method, E1...En => expressions evaluated for each argument
    - operator may be thought of as denoting a function
  - **conditional expressions**
  - **iterative expressions**
  - **constant and variable accesses**
  - **expressions with side effects**
  - **block expressions**

### Statements

- **statements:** construct to execute to update variables i.e. commands
  - **primitive statements:**
    - **noop:** useful mainly for conditionals (e.g. C++ `;`)
    - **assignments:** usually form \`V = E;’ E => expression yielding a value, V => variable access yielding variable reference (i.e. storage location)
    - **method invocation:**
  - **composite statements:**
    - **sequential**
    - **collateral**
    - **conditional**
    - **iterative**
  - **_NOTE:_** language should provide all or most of the above; additional statement forms indication language is probably bloated

## Variables

- **variable**: an entity that abstracts a **storage location**  in an **abstract store** that contains a **value** with **lifetime, assignment, & equality semantics**
  
  - _terminology:_
    
    - they are _units of memory_; often bound to a _symbolic name_ but they do not have a "name"
    - _aliasing:_ is when multiple _symbols_ reference the same variable i.e. storage location
    - they don't have a _type_; variables are _containers for storing values_ and the _value_ they point to has a _type_. language _semantics_ dictate whether variable can be assigned a new value of a different type
    - _l-value:_ the variable's unique location in the store e.g. heap memory address
    - _r-value:_ the actual value
    - _assignment:_ syntactic sugar around addressing/dereferencing + load/store from associated store
      ```cpp
      x = y       := store_update(x.attr['loc'], y.attr['val'])
      operator&() := x.attr['loc']
      operator*() := store_deref(x.attr['loc'])
      ```
  
  - **assignment semantics:** how assigning a composite value to a variable
    
    - **copy semantics:** copies all components of the composite value into the corresponding components of the composite variable
    - **reference semantics:** the composite variable contain a pointer (or reference) to the composite value
  - **equality semantics:** should be consistent with **assignment semantics**
    
    - **copy semantics:** equality tests whether corresponding components of the two composite values are equal
    - **reference semantics:** equality tests whether the pointers to the two composite values are equal
  - **lifetime semantics:** interval between creation/allocation and destruction/deallocated
    
    - _storage space_ must be allocated before lifetime start and deallocated after lifetime end
    - _global variable:_ lifetime is the program’s run-time.
    - _local variable:_ lifetime is an activation of a block
    - _heap variable:_ lifetime is arbitrary, but is bounded by the program’s run-time
    - _persistent variable:_ lifetime is arbitrary, and may transcend the run-time of any particular program (e.g. file)
- **symbolic constants:** immutable _unaddressable_ values i.e. _r-values_
  
  - _implementation detail_ if/where they are stored is
    - for performance, might be opcode encoded immediate literal
    - for memory efficiency, stored in program text segment
    - for runtime debugging, might be local variable or stored in data segment
  - _literal:_ unnamed symbolic constant

## Storage

- **store:** abstract model of where variables reside composed of **storage cells** with unique location
  
  - **storable value:** the atomic unit that can be stored
    - usually primitive values and pointers are storable e.g. primitive values,pointers
    - composite values are not e.g. structs, arrays, unions, objects
  - **storage cell:** abstraction of atomic addressable unit with semantic **(location,status,content)**
    - **status:** either **allocated** or **unallocated**
    - **location:** unique address to reference this cell
    - **content:** for allocated cells either **storable value** or **undefined**
    - **_NOTE:_** implementation may implicitly define these (e.g. storage cells in stack frame implicitly allocated, location usually implicit)
  - **dereferencing:** operation that yielding current content of reference
- **pointer:**  entity that abstracts how a _store_ addresses _typed storage cells_
  
  - i.e. `(loc: typeof(store::address) where typeof(store_val) == ptr_type)`
  - _note:_  usually heap memory address but not always. ex: generational handles, graphics handles, os file handles

### Implementation

- _variable lifetime_ usually determines _storage space allocation_
  - **global variables storage:** static allocation
    - allocation performed at compile time. Compiler translates all names to corresponding location in the code generated by it
    - Ex: all global and static variables in C/C++/Java
  - **local variables storage:** stack allocation in activation frames
    - needed in any language that supports the notion of local variables for methods.
    - Examples: all local variables in C/C++/Java methods and blocks
    - implementation: compiler translates all names to relative offsets from a "activation frame location" of current scope
  - **heap variables storage:** dynamic allocation
    - explicit allocation, freeing e.g., \`malloc/free/new/delete\``
    - explicit allocation, automatic free Java
    - automatic allocation, automatic free Lisp, OCAML

## Bindings

- **environment context:** (possibly named) set of _bindings_ that expressions/statements are interpreted in

- **scope:** program text over which declaration/binding is active
  
  - **symbol's visibility attribute:** determines if a identifier can be reached outside of its scope (e.g. field/method names in C++)
  - **namespaces:** named scope and used to qualify an identifier for reference
  - **static scoping:** associations are determined at compile time
  - **dynamic scoping:** associations are determined at runtime
    - usually confusing and doesn't mesh with statically typed languages
    - algebraic effects are an approach to solve downsides of dynamic scoping
  - Usually one of:
    - global
    - package or module
    - file
    - class
    - method
    - block
- **block:** construct that delimits the scope of any declarations within it

- **name resolution:** determining which entity name refers to in a given _environment context_ i.e. _dereferencing_

- **binding:** mapping of identifier to an entity and it's associated attributes (e.g. value, variable, etc)
  
  - **binding time:** when the attribute can be computed
    - _(static) definition time:_ e.g. boolean, char, type, etc.
    - _(static) implementation time:_ e.g. maxint, float, etc.
    - _(static) compile time:_ e.g. value of n in `const int n = 5;`
    - _(static) link time:_ e.g. definition of function f in `extern int f();`
    - _(static) load time:_ e.g. location of a global variable i.e. memory address
    - _(dynamic) execution time:_ e.g. location, value of variable
  - **binding storage:** determined by binding time
    - _symbol table:_ identifier → static attributes like type
    - _environment context:_ identifier → location
    - _memory:_ location → value
  - **binding/entity lifetime:** important distinction
    - several key events between between names and their associated entity
      - entity creation/destruction for different entity types like variables, methods, types, etc
      - binding entity creation/destruction
      - binding reactivation/deactivation
    - **binding lifetime:** time between the creation and the destruction of a identifier-to-entity binding
    - **entity lifetime:** time between the creation and destruction of an object is the object's lifetime.
    - **entity lifetime != binding lifetime**
      - binding lifetime \< entity lifetime: in pass-by-ref variable to method, the param_name→variable binding \< variable binding
      - binding lifetime > entity lifetime: in use-after-free bug, identifier-to-entity binding > object
- **declarations** are constructs that bind **identifiers** to **entities** in specific **environment context** denoted by **scopes** delimited by **blocks**
  
  - **declaration:** construct that will be elaborated to produce bindings
    - all declarations produce bindings
    - may have side effects e.g. creating variables
    - **type declarations:** binds an identifier to a type (may define a new type or bind an identifier to an existing type e.g. typedef)
    - **constant declarations:** binds an identifier to a constant value.
    - **variable declarations:** creates a single variable and binds an identifier to that variable
      - **variable renaming:** rebinding that allows an identifier to bind to an existing variable
      - **variable rebinding:** change binding of an existing identifier
    - **method definitions:** binds an identifier to a method
  - **definition:** for a declaration whose only effect is to produce bindings

### Context Vs. Scope Vs Lifetime

- **environment context** is delimitation of the program with a set of active _name bindings_
  - a property of _program_ that may be static or dynamic
  - _static context_ portion of program text (aka lexical context)
  - _execution context_ consists of current execution point's lexical context plus additional runtime state such as the call stack (aka execution/runtime/calling/dynamic context)
- **scope of binding:** program region where _name_ is bound to an _entity_
  - it is the _visibility_ of the entity
  - it's _unambiguous_ with _static scoping_ but not _dynamic scoping_
  - it may not coincide with other scopes. ex: with closures, program may enter/leave a given extent multiple times
  - most commonly it's when a given _name_ can refer to a given _variable_ i.e. when a _declaration_ is in effect but can
- **scope of variable** describes where in program text it may be bound
  - is a property of the variable _name binding_
  - the variable's _name scope_ affects its _lifetime_
  - entrance/exit into its scope typically begins/ends its lifetime
- **lifetime/extent** of a variable describes where in program execution it has meaningful value
  - is a _runtime_ property of the variable itself
  - is a _subset_ of scope and may or may not overlap
    - a name can be bound to a variable but variable's value has not been allocated/assigned. (bug if name binding dereferenced before)
    - a variable may exist but be inaccessible e.g. memory leak bug
    - accessible but not via the given name in given context e.g. persistent value like file
    - binding scope might come into context/out of context repeatedly while variable lifetime is active e.g. closures or static local variable lifetime is duration of program, but

### Implementation

- **symbol table:** names→attributes: - data structure maintaining bindings of names to
  - conventionally static attributes
  - needs to efficiently handle identifier lookup in presence of scope changes
  - usually implemented with hash table + scope stack
    - hashtable handles identifier → attribute lookup
    - top of stack is current scope, bottom is outermost
- **environment context:** (runtime) mapping of variable identifier to location
  - **binding_of:** fn(scope,identifier)->location
  - Ex: `binding_of("local_var_foo") := env.current_scope.stack_bp + local_var_foo.attr["stackOffset"]`
  - dynamic language features require more complicated _environment context_ (e.g. walking up activation records for dynamic scoping)
- **store:** runtime equivalent of symbol table (i.e. memory). defines semantics:
  - **value_at:** fn(location) → value : how a location attribute is resolved to a value
  - **value_update:** fn(location,new_val): how a value attribute is copied

## Functions

- **formal parameter:** identifier through which a method can access an argument

- **argument/actual parameter:** value or entity that is passed to a method

- **calling convention:** low level implementation detail of how methods receive/return parameters e.g.
  
  - where (parameters, return values, return addresses, scope links,etc) are placed (registers,stack, memory,etc)
  - coordination details between caller/callee on how new _environment context_ is created and restored between invocation/return
- **parameter semantics:** how formal parameter is associated to corresponding argument
  
  - **copy parameter semantics:** binds the formal parameter to a local variable that contains a copy of the argument
    - **copy-in parameter:** (aka pass-by-value) corresponds to an (initialized) variable declaration where identifier is bound to variable
      - on invocation, a local variable is created & initialized with the argument value
      - side effects to local variable only visible within function scope
    - **copy-out parameter:** (aka pass-by-result) no corresponding declaration form
      - argument must be a variable
      - on invocation, a local variable is created but not initialized.
      - on return, local variable’s final value is assigned to the argument variable
    - **copy-inout parameter:** (aka pass-by-copy-restore) no corresponding declaration form
      - the argument must be a variable
      - on invocation, a local variable is created and initialized with the argument variable’s current value
      - on return, local variable’s final value is assigned back to the argument variable
  - **reference parameter semantics:** (aka pass-by-ref) binds the formal parameter directly to the argument itself
    - **constant parameter:** corresponds to a constant definition where an identifier is bound to a first-class value
      - argument must be a value
      - formal parameter bound to the argument value during method
      - Thus any inspection of FP is actually an indirect inspection of the argument value
    - **variable parameter:** corresponds to a variable renaming definition where identifier is bound to an existing variable
      - argument must be a variable
      - formal parameter bound to the argument variable during method
      - Thus any inspection (or updating) of FP is actually an indirect inspection (or updating) of the argument variable

### Implementation

- **activation frame:** bookkeeping data necessary for evaluation of current method
  - space for all local variables
  - space for return address (where execution should resume on exit from the current method)
  - other info such as parameter values, etc.
- **calling convention:** semantics of how activation record stack is managed on entry/exit
- **function prologue/epilogue:** compiler inserted sections into functions that implement activation record push/pop on entry/exit in accordance with calling convention

## Control Flow

- **sequencer** construct to transfer control to **destination**; can implement variety of control flows, with multiple entries and/or multiple exits
  - **jump:** sequencer transferring control to a point denoted by **label**
    - Ex: `jump Foo;`
  - **escape:** sequencer terminating execution of a textually enclosing statement or method
    - allows for single-entry multi-exit control flows
    - Ex: `break;`

### Implementation

- jump/escape must be handle control transfer differently depending on _environment context_
  - within block: nothing to manage
  - out of block: must destroy block's local variables before control transfer
  - out of method: the method’s activation frame must be popped off the stack before control transfer

## Insights

- Error messages are the user interface to your programming language
- Most powerful thing you have is flow-control in a language
- Don't make types at compile time
- **Type Completeness Principle:** No operation should be arbitrarily restricted in the types of its operands
  - motivation: suggests that all types in the language should have equal status
  - good example: `boolean and` operation: argument restriction to bool types is bc intentional not arbitrary
  - bad example: language not allowing functions to be passed as parameters
- **Qualification Principle:** It is possible to include a block in any syntactic category, provided that the constructs in that syntactic category specify some kind of computation
  - ex: **block expression/statement:** where block local declarations are only visible to block expressions/statements
  - ex: **block declaration:** where local declarations D are only used for elaborating subdeclarations E
    - essentially distinguishes between private (local) and public subdeclarations
    - usually disguised as classes/packages, but naked support is uncommon
    - used extensively in Zig where `pub` keyword delimits what is public or not
- **The Abstraction Principle:** It is possible to design procedures that abstract over any syntactic category, provided only that the constructs in that syntactic category specify some kind of computation.
  - motivation: encourage abstraction over other syntactic categories such as abstracting over declarations, types
  - ex: **pure function:** abstracts over an expression
    - has a body that is an expression
    - invocation is an expression that will yield a result by evaluating the function procedure’s body
  - ex: **method:** abstracts over a statements
    - body that is a statement
    - invocation is a statement that will update variables by executing the proper procedure’s body
  - ex: **selector procedure:** abstracting over a variable access (aka property getters/setters)
    - body is a variable access
    - invocation yields a variable by evaluating the selector procedure’s body
- **Correspondence Principle:** For each form of declaration there exists a corresponding parameter semantics
  - motivation: programmers can easily and reliably generalize blocks into procedures.
  - converse is not always true (e.g. copy-out/copy-inout)
  - ex: **copy-in parameter**: corresponds to an (initialized) variable declaration where identifier is bound to variable
  - ex: **constant parameter**: corresponds to a constant definition. In each case, an identifier is bound to a first-class value
  - ex: **variable parameter**: corresponds to a variable renaming definition where identifier is bound to an existing variable
