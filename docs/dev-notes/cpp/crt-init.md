# CRT Initialization

## Default DLL entry point \_DllMainCRTStartup

In Windows, all DLLs can contain an optional entry-point function, usually called `DllMain`, that is called for both initialization and termination. This gives you an opportunity to allocate or release additional resources as needed.
Windows calls the entry-point function in four situations: process attach, process detach, thread attach, and thread detach. 

- _process attach_ When a DLL is loaded into a process address space, either when an application that uses it is loaded, or when the application requests the DLL at runtime, the operating system creates a separate copy of the DLL data
- _Thread attach_ occurs when the process the DLL is loaded in creates a new thread
- _Thread detach_ occurs when the thread terminates, and _process detach_ is when the DLL is no longer required and is released by an application. 

The operating system makes a separate call to the DLL entry point for each of these events, passing a _reason_ argument for each event type. For example, the OS sends `DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH` as the _reason_ argument to signal process attach.
The VCRuntime library provides an entry-point function called `_DllMainCRTStartup` to handle default initialization and termination operations

On process attach, the `_DllMainCRTStartup` function 

- sets up buffer security checks
- initializes the CRT and other libraries
- initializes run-time type information
- initializes and calls constructors for static and non-local data
- initializes thread-local storage, increments an internal static counter for each attach
- and then calls a user- or library-supplied `DllMain` 
  On process detach, the function goes through these steps in reverse. 
- It calls `DllMain`
- decrements the internal counter
- calls destructors
- calls CRT termination functions and registered `atexit` functions
- notifies any other libraries of termination
  When the attachment counter goes to zero, the function returns `FALSE` to indicate to Windows that the DLL can be unloaded. 
  The `_DllMainCRTStartup` function is also called during thread attach and thread detach. In these cases, the VCRuntime code does no additional initialization or termination on its own, and just calls `DllMain` to pass the message along
  If `DllMain` returns `FALSE` from process attach, signaling failure, `_DllMainCRTStartup` calls `DllMain` again and passes `DLL_PROCESS_DETACH` as the _reason_ argument, then goes through the rest of the termination process.
