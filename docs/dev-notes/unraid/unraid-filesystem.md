# Unraid File System

- `/`:         OS runs entirely off RAM disk
  - loaded from flash usb drive
  - not persistent i.e. erased on reboot/shutdown
- `/boot`:     where flash drive is mounted e.g. the boot drive
- `/mnt`:      where hard drives are mounted e.g. `cache`, `disk1`, `disk2`, etc
- `/mnt/user`: where user shares are mounted

## Boot Flash Drive

boot drive root gets mounted at `/boot`
