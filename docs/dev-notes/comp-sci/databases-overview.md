- [chidb](http://chi.cs.uchicago.edu/chidb/index.html): a book in the vein of crafting interpreters on databases
   > 
   > chidb is a didactic relational database management system (RDBMS) designed for teaching how a RDBMS is built internally, from the data organization in files all the way up to the SQL parser and query optimizer.
   > The design of chidb is based on SQLite, with several simplifying assumptions that make it possible to develop a complete chidb implementation over the course of a quarter or semester.
   > One of the key similarities is that chidb uses a single file to store all its information (database metadata, tables, and indexes).
   > In fact, the chidb file format is a subset of SQLite, meaning that well-formed chidb files will also be well-formed SQLite files (the opposite, though, is not necessarily true).
