# Common Techniques

- Convert Splines to Geo: Polyline or wire node
- Convert Polygon to Volume
  - Use GameDev Voxel Mesh Node: Creates watertight mesh
  - Use VDB From Polygons Node: Needs watertight mesh
- Convert Volume to Polygon:
  - Convert VDB: Convert to=polygons
- Convert Volume to surface/isosurface/sdf:
  - Convert VDB: VDB Class: Fog -> SDF
  - VDB Topology to SDF: will create shrink wrapped sdf around active vdb nodes. By definition, will create water tight meshes

## Poly Clean Up

- Workflow
  1. Roundtrip: Polymesh to vdb back to polygons to remove small interior triangles
  2. PolyDoctor (better version of clean) to detect mesh issues
  3. Run instantmeshes to quadrangulate
  4. PolyReduce to reduce down topology
  5. Divide to triangulate
- Workflow Alt
  - Remesh => to create uniform triangle sizes of everything
