# General Vellum Tips

- Add remesher or triangluate into your cloth mesh
- **Edge Fracture**: to add random pattern of tears
- **Unwanted bounciness**: Reduce Max Acceleration
- **Attach To Geo**: Use Rest Length Scale to 0.1 to snap things really close to the geo
- **Compression Stiffness:** If you set Thickness to 0.001, then increase Compression Stiffness to 100,000 to accommodate and to avoid folds smoothing out
- **Constraint Iterations:** Higher resolution cloth means you need higher constraint iterations
- **Bend Plasticity:** allows cloth to update rest length on its bend constraints as it deforms. Useful for denim or heavy fabrics
