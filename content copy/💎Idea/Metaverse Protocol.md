Metaverse likely coming. The important thing is that "new" jobs will always contain an element of human interaction since that is the only thing we don't want done by an AI. I dont want to play siege against bots. Jobs will be like playing siege or chess.

Metaverse protocol allows for global playerbase with ability for games to access and read/write arbitrary data/stats that can be accessed in all other games for complete persistent online presence.

This could be relatively lightweight to start up and even offered to game companies for free as an incentive to use our public database but then we become the backbone of the metaverse and create a virtual hub that routes players to all different games in a seamless experience.
