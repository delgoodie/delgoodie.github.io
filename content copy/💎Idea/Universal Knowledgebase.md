The biggest problem with AI is data quality. Statements need to be correct and useful and there needs to be lots of them. The web has large quantity but quality is hard to find. RAG is 100% the future of information because it allows AI to not know the information / have it baked into sub which is much to hard for the near infinite number of true statements that exist beyond logical deduction (how many car crashes happened in 1993). 

A universal knowledgebase must be constructed. It must contain vast breadth over all subjects without repetition or contradiction and should especially focus on science, math, engineering, and other logical subjects. Maybe history. 

To construct such a database, we must use... AI

Four teams of agents must work together, scouts, clerks, judges, and librarians.

#### Scouts
The role of the scouts is to index the internet. Basically they crawl through web pages and try to find any useful information they can extract from the page. They work closely with clerks to know what information is useful, sifting through text, audio, video, etc.
#### Clerks
The clerks are ultimate middle men and communicate with scouts about what information they already have any what they need. The clerks must actually "file" the information obtained by the scouts and must know "where" it should go in relation to the whole knowledgebase.
#### Judges
The judges simply read the knowledgebase as often as possible and scrutinize it for inconsistencies, contradictions, poor wording, incompleteness, etc. They press the clerks for better information or tell them to remove data. Ideally there are many judges but each with a different specialization (fine tuning) for different fields. A physics judge would be extra good at spotting inconsistencies in physics data.
#### Librarians
The three previous roles are enough to build a knowledgebase but the librarians are the face of such a knowledgebase. They are basically just regular AIs with RAG on the entire knowledgebase. Maybe instead of just non-ai search they can ask clerks where to look for information.


Once a knowledgebase can be constructed, it can be used to train even better AI on and can be a ground source truth for ALL RAG! If the knowledgebase is opensource, people can also contribute if they find nuanced issues in the information. 

With a knowledgebase of such scale there are endless possibilities. The two most important are:
1. Massive increase in effective intelligence of LLMs
2. Possible pattern discovery across fields
3. Incubator to train newer more intelligent models

Such a feat would truly be the pinnacle of human creation and it would also be interesting to see just how much the data could be reduced until it was the complete set of unique human knowledge.
