Card game for 4-14 players

Separate out the role cards, face cards and jokers. Remove unused role cards so that there is only one per player, balancing equal number of red and black with an odd number adding one joker. Randomize and deal face-down a role card to each player. They can look at their own role, but no one else's.

Shuffle the deck and pull out two (three if playing with joker) secret cards, face down, and put them in the middle of the table. Then everyone closes their eyes and each person takes a turn opening their eyes and flipping their team's secret card, then turning it back over.

Once everyone knows their secret card, five more cards are drawn face down, mixed and randomized with the three secret cards, and then displayed face up in the center of the table, forming the courtyard. 

Each person is then given five cards in their hand, and play begins. During the round, anyone can play cards at any time to the play pile. Each card has a different role.

- Seven: allows you to see another player's hand
- Any Card: Send a card to another player
- Two: Block the action of another card
- Ace: See role of another player
- Nine: Force player to vote selected card
- Five: Steal a card of your choice (must be requested) from another player

Then at the end of the round, everyone casts a vote by laying a card from their hand, facedown. All the votes are collected, randomized, then revealed. For every card in the courtyard, if there is one vote card which matches it's suit, and one vote card which matches its rank, it is assassinated.

If you assassinate the enemy's secret card before you're own, you win.


Problem w/ vote cards being same as action card, ie, need 5 to take a card but if 5 is the other team's secret card, then you have to use a five to get a five so its frustrating. Need to be able to take action quickly if you know the enemy's secret card.

Also need better ways to get info ab enemies secret card. We got in gridlock where we knew each other's alliances, but no way of getting more info ab secret card. 

Last: if the rounds go fast, can we eliminate the eyes down stuff at the start since its slow.
