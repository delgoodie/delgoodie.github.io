Dad, Dave, and Luke Malanga listen to music in the shower. 
Luke and Dad both very bad with names

Talking is best done by the subconscious, given the person is reasonably smart. These three men are all socially intelligent, enjoy stimulation, are not super motivated, and yet seem to lack some level of coherency in their inner thought. 


There is a separate axis of the mind, uncorrelated to intelligence, that is responsible for the frequency of consciousness usage. Some people just tend to go to the sub more often to retrieve behavior. Maybe it is even almost an aversion as Dad and Dave seem to both loathe self-thought and also have a "frenzied" inner thought experience, or maybe it is more like Luke who just says and does things with little conscious effort involved. 

Upon Steven asking Luke if he liked cats, he replies "No", sitting right next to Meg. Irrecoverably, Steven shuffles to change the conversation.

This axis seems to still be disconnected from intelligence since all three are decently smart, they just hit a local max faster. Also they tend to be more socially confident as they don't perceive themselves as "not having it". I know this is an incorrect analysis of Dad however because he is somewhat contemplative, however, very unmotivated to use his intelligence productively.

Phil is probably a good example of someone who falls into this category but is of less intelligence and so he is overall weakened by this, whereas people see Dad and Dave as funny.

This could also cause these men to be more affected by stimulation, since each of them enjoy a lot of it, and this could relate to sensing vs intuition, since they are also driven by their gut (Dad).
