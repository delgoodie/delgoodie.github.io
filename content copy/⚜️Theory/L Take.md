An L take is simply a **losing** stance, opinion, or mindset. The most important aspect of L takes is that holding them frequently damages the individual and can isolate them from rationality.

#### Evidential L
When your pet theory is morally upright, mathematically beautiful, or strikingly simple, yet small pecks of evidence continue to degrade your take, it is an evidential L take. Unfortunately, the evidence is not significant enough to outright disprove your theory, and you can usually find a way to explain how this case fits, but you often have more observations that break rather than fit the rule.

#### Denial L
Could be right but also possibly wrong and believing it causes you to live a worse life. "She would never say yes".

#### Superiority L
You think what your doing makes you superior and it probably is better for you but the work is more effort than the reward. "People that mediate for 4hrs or go to every daily mass".
