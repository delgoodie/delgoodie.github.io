A page full of alternating blue and green dots contains lots of data, however, upon further inspection, all the information on the page could be expressed as the pattern, one blue one green, and then the count over which the pattern is repeated. Alternatively, data can be expanded. Two nouns and a verb might be sufficient to communicate an idea, but they are wrapped with conjunctions, adverbs, prepositions, etc. In order for data to be compressed, there must be some order, symmetry, pattern to the data. Fortunately, there are patterns all around us. In an information dense environment, not taking advantage of inherent symmetries in this information would be like doing large arithmetic in your head; possible but most definitively an [[L take]]. 

fundamentally: The universe has more symmetry than we can perceive

Per Holograph theory, the universe is a projection of a 2D boundary onto 3D space, or a 3D boundary onto a 4D spacetime. The fundamental "information" of the universe is played out on this information dense lower dimensional space. We experience a projection of this space, likely because evolutionarily it was easier for us to find patterns in the higher dimensional space as they would be of lower order. We are just now peeking into the true nature of the universe, however, I do not think the projection is a simple as 2D -> 3D. There must be a phase shift / rotation between addition dimension which accounts for the "probability" and "WF collapse" hoax of quantum mechanics. It might be completely impossible for us to confirm, maybe there isn't even a "right" version, whatever that means.


The brain creates intelligence, it does so by relating and transforming data in extremely dense input and output spaces. It does this with very low power, relatively few neurons, and the motivation of a human. Chat runs on 25,000 GPUs using half a million kilowatt hours per day of energy. Most of us are still more intelligent than chat (dont forget physical intelligence such as motor skills and memory).

Quantum entanglement stores orders of magnitude more information that classical systems and can collapse state such that patterns can be evaluated quickly.


The Neuron is a Qbit.

Our brains are fundamentally quantum computers, the hidden dimensions that govern quantum mechanics also govern consciousness. 

We are simply tied to this projection, but are not of it. Take off the goggles.
