To the dawdmodern perspective there might seem to be a plethora of sexual orientations: straight, gay, bi, and then all the genders like trans, non-b, etc. Conservatives acknowledge gay as wrong but don't acknowledge trans, however, in thinking, I came to a different conclusion.

It would seem wrong to think that sexuality is a basis vector of mental composition. Rarely do real world notions like math or geology align with true properties of the brain like memory or intelligence, however, these societal fields are a mixture of many properties of the brain. Likewise it should be the same for sexuality. In consideration of gay people, there is almost always an increase in feminine characteristics. Their voices are higher, they talk lightly, move like a girl, etc. This could be explained as trying to appear more like a girl to attract the same sex, however, this behavior appears in gay kids far earlier than their development of sexual desire, and the social awareness to appear desirable, and even before the kids themselves know they are gay. Therefore, sexuality is not a property, but femininity / masculinity is a property, in which too much femininity leads to female behaviors and merely consequently, an attraction toward men. This would mean that gays are really more like transgenders. Gender or femininity / masculinity is a binary spectrum, of which sexuality is proportional. I believe there must be people who are still straight, but less attracted to girls than I am. They are close enough to the man side that they don't like men, plus society gives a fat shift towards the extremes to anyone who is close to the center (which is good). I also think there are probably guys who like girls more than me (maybe one or two). This is all probably highly correlated to testosterone / estrogen.

Why do gay men have a high voice? Are their vocal cords genetically different? Is having a high voice intrinsic to women? No. I think the femininity manifests itself in who the person mimics in behaviors, especially in early development. A feminine boy will mimic the mother more and follow her behaviors. 

Is it developmental then? Maybe. Could be that certain butterfly effects in early age cause children to either mimic mother or father leading to self perpetuating hormone releases, seems unlikely though. Probably just a genetic mutation for men to have high estrogen or vice versa.

Tests that could be performed:
Correlation of gay ~ Estrogen levels (pre-meds)
hormone profile comparison of gays, transgenders, etc
hormone levels as child comparison to adult / teen gayness
voice pitch x hormone levels x sexuality
Partial prob of Gay / Guys first words being mama (or vice versa)

Of course a huge inconsistency in the data is all the confused people. If there is one think humans want more than sex, it is to belong...
