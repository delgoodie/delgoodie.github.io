GÃ¶del's Theorem says there are things which we know to be true that can not be proven mathematically or logarithmically.

Tiling with certain shapes cannot be calculated via any algorithm, however, humans can do it, therefore they demonstrate some understanding beyond computation. 

If a neural network could be generated to solve the tiling problem it could end up giving answers to tile patterns that would "mostly" be correct, but not always, yet it is still an algorithm.

But aren't we the same...

We can't truly know anything beyond the hidden probabilistic bias of our neural network

we are fundamentally incapable of dealing with emergence. It is that thing which arises from an incomprehensible scale.
Randomness does not exist.

Consciousness is definitely a spectrum. In dream state I am conscious but much less than reality. I "feel" less and am much less rational, but still feel.

I know I am conscious when dreaming because it is impossible to experience a perspective or to experience existence without being conscious and I am experiencing existence while dreaming. Especially when lucid dreaming but this is not a fundamentally different state than normal dreaming, just a higher level of con, so therefore still con when normal dreaming.

Consciousness can "go into" things. When you watch a movie, your con goes into the protagonist and you emulate them. Same when you read a book, play a video game. When Dad drives the car, it becomes his body; his con thinks on the level of forward, back, left, right. It seems to be deeply linked to the sub in that the sub "delivers" sense information and "receives" action information on the dataspace that the con is "in". This dataspace is arbitrary and when Dad drives a car it is abstracted to the car but when you watch a movie it is elsewhere. So it is almost more controlled by the sub but actually experienced by the con.
