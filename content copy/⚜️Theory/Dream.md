Each night the human body goes through cycles of sleep, each cycle around 90 minutes. Most of each cycle is deep sleep, but a quarter, or 22 minutes is REM sleep. This is the stage of each cycle where you dream. This means every night you achieve around 90 minutes of total dreams. I have experimentally found dreams to last around 20 minutes.

The point of deep sleep is very obvious: body restoration. You build muscle, repair tissue, and rest for the next day. The point of REM is less obvious. You enter an extremely heightened mental state and have false experiences. Why?

It was commonly thought that dreams exist to run us through tough situations and de-risk them since adrenaline is not active in the brain during dreams despite us experiencing adrenaline filled situations. This doesn't seem to work though. After countless dreams about insects, I am not any less creeped out by spiders.

> We are conscious when we dream

After lucid dreaming for a long time, I pondered the moment at which I become lucid, the spark that takes me from the dream state, to the awareness that I am inside it. I realized that this feeling, is the exact same feeling I get when I wake up and maybe initially forget my dream, but then the memories flood back into my head and I realize I spent a whole night of living up there. 

> The feeling of becoming "lucid" is the feeling of regaining memory of your external life

Both mechanisms, waking up and remembering you dreams, and become lucid in a dream, rely on the failure of the same "memory-block" brain mechanism. They can both be trained to fail via practice and conditioning, both yield the same sensation, and both yield the same result: access to memory. After all, if you weren't conscious in the normal dream, how would you even remember experiencing it. Consciousness is simply to perceive, experience, be stimulated.

If the only difference between normal dreaming and lucid dreaming is access to memory of the external world, and we are conscious when lucid dreaming, then we must be conscious when normally dreaming.

Additionally, if we can control our dreams consciously when lucid, we must also be able to control normal dreams with our conscious. Why then do we not feel like we are in control? Often it is the opposite and the dream is in control of us. This is because we do not know it is a dream. We expect "reality" and it happens.

> What you consciously expect to happen, happens

This sheds a much better perspective on nightmares than the old theory. If you have an irrational fear of insects, and you see an insect in a dream, you will expect it to attack you as that is what your fear the most and in some sense give irrational credence to happening. Alternatively if you have a massive ego, you will expect everyone to bow down to you. Children have more nightmares because they are afraid of more things.

So then what is the point of dreams?

> Dreams let the sub learn from the con

Likely the sub is learning "how reality works" since the con expects, and thus brings into fruition, reality as they perceive it. The sub can then bake this information to small programs.

But this implies that there is something to be learned at all from the con that the sub doesn't already possess, however, I don't think this necessarily means that they are fundamentally different. Chat converges on the answer better if it "talks itself through" the problem.

Consciousness is clearly a spectrum however. Some dreams we are totally irrational and fall for things that we would never believe in real life. We are simply less conscious. Reality is maximally conscious however, even in this state you can fade consciousness by drugs, tiktok, or dull / repetitive tasks.
