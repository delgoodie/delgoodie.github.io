Just thought of a baller weight loss workout plan:

Monday - Long Cardio
Tuesday - Weight Training
Wednesday - Rest
Thursday - Long Cardio
Friday - Weight Training
Saturday  - Rest
Sunday - Rest

#### Long Cardio
On these days skip lunch and then do Stairmaster or incline treadmill at ~6pm for 1.5 hrs. On the empty stomach, you won't be able to use undigested food or glycogen for fuel and the intensity is low enough that your body will consume fat. It will be painful on an empty stomach but you can distract yourself with podcasts. Also eating after workout will trigger your body to not store it as fat since it expects you to do that again.
Do sauna afterward!
#### Weight Training
Lifting is also good for weight loss and prevents muscle loss. It also keeps your body from storing the food you eat as fat.
#### Rest
Just don't eat too much and maybe walk.
