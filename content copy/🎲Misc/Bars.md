Real Gs move in silence like lasagna

My feet don't touch the ground I'm floatin

I aint into mixin my hoes with my business

This is America, my president is black and my lambo is blue

Like I went blind dog you gotta hand it to me

And nothing would be finer that to be in Carolina

Hate me never met me in the Flesh

They say that what's done in the dark will find a way to shine

He swear he so creative turned a toothbrush to a knife

How I make a milli from a dollar it was dummy luck

God bless the man I put the sights over

Stay down till you come up I been sticking to that theory

Standing on a field full of land mines, doing the moon walk, hope I blow up in time

Alone for the umpteenth time or more

140 Characters in these streets

Well if the devils in the details then I'm satanic

Outside you smiling but inside you crying you know it sucks to be you, chose to look like a fool

These days, I'm letting God handle all things above me. The things I can't change are the reasons you love me.

Im aggravated, agitated, I admit intoxicated, animated, got me feelin kinda lit

I'm gon let you know that the man is for real

I'm falling in and out of clouds don't worry I'm a get it granny
