### #1  People need high ceilings
Completely irrational things like high ceilings actually affect our mood which affects our mindset and actions and life.

### #2 People go with the flow
People are easily impressionable and since we are neural nets we can easily fall for things that don't fully make sense simply because they fall within a wide margin of possible and we are too weak to think critically. Eg. walking into a building while holding a ladder and no one stops you, but it obviously extends much deeper to every word you say in a conversation. Goal is to be meta-aware of this. Additionally people go with the flow as in they are too weak to resist the norm, this is more meta because people are self aware of this. It is the same phenomena on a macro scale. People will conform eg smartphones, instagram, clothes, drinking, etc. They choose to go with the flow to fit in and be accepted. Lastly, go with the flow also means people choose the path of least resistance. If something is more work, it will eventually fizzle out. If you think a group of people is "hard" just keep looking and you will find they have fish Fridays and consummations.
