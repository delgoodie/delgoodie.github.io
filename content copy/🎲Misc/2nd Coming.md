Within the next century humans will solve aging. This will present us with the hardest trial to ever exist: the question of whether or not to be "cured". Taking the cure would be directly denying the existence of God, since you are making it impossible to be with God. Not taking the cure would mean that, if you're wrong, you will die for absolutely no reason. Everything to lose, nothing to gain. Eventually, the real believers will die, slowly weeding out the population until there are only non-believers. At or slightly before this point. Jesus must come. If the 2nd coming does not happen, Christianity must be false because a world without believers or knowledge of Jesus essentially makes it impossible to come to God meaning there would be no point to life.

This will be a harder decision than any martyrdom, sainthood, veteran, patriot, ect. All the people of the past had to die, the fact that they did for God or in belief of God is noble and honorable, but they still had to die. Once death is a choice, the existence of God rises to the most normative belief possible and requires a decision that is made with no possible alternative motive. In a way, the pre-death-cure world used religion to cope with death. It could be argued that it is highly likely that a moderately intelligent species would create religion to come to terms with their finite existence. When this no longer becomes the case the relationship between religion and death is reversed. Religion implies that you must choose death. Ironically, you can either have eternal life on earth or in heaven.

Religion is the treatment of death, science is the cure.

A person who tries to kill themselves is labeled as depressed and suicidal. This is a state of mental illness, a disease, that in theory could be solved. In a death cured society, belief means not being cured, which means choosing death instead of eternal life. It would be seen as a mental illness. An infectious ideology that could poison the mind, leading to the organism's own destruction. Naturally, a society would not want this ideology to spread to the youth, the impressionable generations, as it would only cause unnecessary casualties. This mental illness would need to be cured. Killing those who are diseased might even be justifiable because "they were going to die anyway". The difference of 50 years means nothing to someone who will live forever.

Alternatively for the people that stay on earth, it could be that earth becomes the living hell. They choose their hell by staying eternally alive
