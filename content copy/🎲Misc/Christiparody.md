400 iq jewish man invents time machine in year 3000. 
he decides to use it to go back in time and make the world a better place so there wouldn't be so many wars and deaths
he decides to form a religion
he gathers a bunch of high tech devices that would demonstrate his "god-like" powers and goes back in time.
he performs miracles, and great works and everyone believes in him.
he has to leave to return to the present so he decides he will escape by dying and frames himself. His fellow Jews hate him the most because he is "one of them" and so they personally push for his death.

he is "killed" and uses technology to fake his own death, but people from the future inform him that the religion never stuck. He comes back to visit several people to motivate them to spread to religion, however, upon reaching a critical point, the religion "sticks" such that his motivation is sufficient to permeate through the future and grow the religion permanently, as if reaching critical mass. At this moment, WW2 and the Holocaust causally happen, which trigger the death of the man's bloodline, ending his existence in all of spacetime. 

No one of 400 iq is ever to be born again, thus fate is sealed.
