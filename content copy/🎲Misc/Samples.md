Can I get a kiss      *can I*
and can you make it last forever      *can you*
I'm bout to say goodbye
and I don't know if ima see you again

I think that I'm in love
and I don't know if ima see you again

I said I'm bout to go to war
and I don't know if ima see you again



Slow down, you move too fast girl,
you've got to make the, moment last just
kicking down the cobblestones
looking for fun and, feelin groovy



I wanna know, can you take me far away
give me a star to shoot for, tell me where to go
I'll go so high
I'll go so high my feet won't touch the ground
just stitch my wings, and pull the strings
I bought these dreams
That all fall down

Spittin bullets when I rap call me billy the kid
