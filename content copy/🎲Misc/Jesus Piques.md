Jesus transcends space and time, therefore you can pray to Jesus at any time in his life and he hears you from the past. You could pray to Jesus while he is actively on the cross in his last breaths.

Jesus is the bread of life. Jesus was born in a manger, which is a feeding trough, Bethlehem means the house of bread. 

Jesus is the word. To give your word means to vow a promise. God gave us Jesus as a promise of eternal life. Jesus is God giving us his word.

Hope is the ultimate form of happiness, Jesus is the ultimate faxiom of hope. It doesn't even need to be real.
