### Mental Clock
1. Practice keeping visual clock in head which keeps real time (developed through practice)
2. Develop clock to become impulsive, unforgettable, and highly accurate
3. Test if clock will remain accurate after sleep (is subconscious "ticking" while sleeping)
4. Test if clock is on / accurate during dreaming (time perception in dream state)
