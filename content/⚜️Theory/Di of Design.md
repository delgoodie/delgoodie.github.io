There are two categories: Architecture and Implementation.

Implementation is the nuts and bolts of how a problem is solved. It practically addresses the literal needs of achieving a goal or effect. The architecture is one step above the implementation, and defines how the implementation fits into the bigger picture of the software. 

These definitions are general on purpose, since this dichotomy is more of a ladder in which every point could be looked at as either above you (step up) or below you (step down). It is critical to address the entire ladder of the project, and assess which steps can be effectively utilized.

For a video game, starting from the bottom rung:

- Compiler / Machine Code
- C++ Code
- Design Pattern / Class structure
- Module, plugin, class struct
- Services, Software 

Looking at this list, we have minimal control over the compiler and machine code, this also only provides usefulness in optimization.

C++ code is the most user-expressive and the best level to operate as the implementation category. It is still heab
