draft: true
---

- a property of the consciousness
- can not be increased or decreased (probably, or this effect is negligible)
- could even be constant among all people? or determined genetically? irrelevant
- mental state as a potential function
- limited willpower can be used to go up the potential (like water, will erode / reshape the potential to make the new path smoother, ie more favorable, ie requiring less willpower subsequently)
- potential will always regress toward base desires, sex, food, etc (because of how low they are in sub?)
- is it really finite, how does it get reguvinated? (maybe sleep, ie the lack of consciousness)
- In a parallel universe people would still sing in the shower
