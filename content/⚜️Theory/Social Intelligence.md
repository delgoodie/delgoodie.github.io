Three categories of people (social intelligence):

1. Aren't aware of their actions or others
2. Aware of their own actions but not others
3. Aware of their own actions and others

Level 1 is people like Phil or Colby who have a blank stare and are unaware that they come off ridiculously. 

Level 2 is most people, including myslef, who are too self absorbed and focused on what they are saying and how to not come off like a moron because they arent super confident

Level 3 is the master class social manipulators like Tommy and Nolan who can shmooze people because they understand how their actions affect others and are confident enough to not need hyper attention on how they act

Confidence is a ramp and in no way intrinsic to personality, can be scaled up or down.
