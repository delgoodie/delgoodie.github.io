You want to achieve your goals, we know there are billions of people who all want to achieve their goals, but every year most of them don't. It is not because their goals are too hard, most people set goals that are pretty reasonable, have been accomplished by plenty of other people, to some people won't even be considered a challenge worth settings as a goal. So why don't we achieve are goals?

There are two reasons why you could not achieve a goal, either one: the goal is too difficult, you are not equip to tackle it, you don't have the right tools etc. or two: you lose motivation, change your mind, forget, or turn against your goal. As foolish, selfish, hedonistic, and illogical people, we tend to lose to the second reason. So then achieving your goals is not a matter of the implementation, the specific actions required, but a matter of not losing motivation to continue pursuing the goal. So how do we keep motivated?

First my two tools which will make the concept of maintaining motivation easy

## Theory of Mind
The mind is composed of two parts, the conscious and subconscious, con and sub. The con is your internal awareness, your logic and reasoning, and continuous perspective. The sub is everything else. It is best to think of the sub as a neural network like chatgpt. It takes input and delivers output, it is trained off a large set of data, namely all of your experiences, and is in charge of 99% of your life. The con lives purely engulfed in the sub. You can't feel, hear, see, smell, or taste anything without that information traveling through the nervous system and sub. Your emotions are produced from the sub, but experienced by the con. The sub also prompts the con with thoughts. Likewise you cannot take action without going through the sub, you may will your arm to grab the apple consciously, but the sub must take the abstract intention of grabbing the apple and parse it into patterns which ultimately lead to the complex symphony of muscular signals which result in grabbing an apple. Lastly, the sub is very powerful, many times more than chatgpt and many more times than your con. The purpose of the two is a harmonic dance of learning. The con can learn things logically and quickly. I can explain to you how to add base 5 numbers, and you can, tediously, do it. Tediously because the con is very weak. If I asked you to add 2 + 2, your sub would do it before you even fully comprehended the question. It recognized the pattern. It feels like memory is kind of a cheap pattern, but your sub can do much more complex things than memory. When playing ping pong, I will sometimes swing at the ball but then it misses the table, and I realized that I'm starting the swing before I even see that the ball hits the table, and furthermore I finish the full swing before realizing the ball didn't hit. Consciously it seems as though I've revealed that I'm just guessing where the ball will go and taking a swing instead of precisely tracking it with my vision. In reality, it is just my sub developing a niche set of pattern recognition to adjust the placement and power of my paddle based on the position of the ball 2 seconds prior. Much more complex than 2+2, purely subconscious. The issue with the sub is that it is very slow to learn. You can not instantly add numbers in base 5 because your sub hasn't had enough time to internalize these patterns. If you practiced every day, you could start to build up and understanding, what people like to call intuition. So basically the process of learning is first completed by the con, which can learn quickly but computes slowly, then moved to the sub which learns slowly but can compute quickly. This dynamic of learning between the con and sub is so critical I believe it is the basis for dreams. The idea behind the sub is that, if you do something enough, your sub will internalize it because it is worth learning since you do it a lot, thus freeing up your con to tackle new challenges. The issue is that this learning isn't restricted to conventional learning like math or riding a bike. The sub doesn't filter between school, personal life, hobbies, etc. It just learns behaviors. If you consciously think about how inadequate you are how much better everyone else is, that's a behavior. Sub will pick it up and then prompt you more frequently with thoughts of inadequacy. No behavior is out of reach of the sub.
## Belief
I believe that belief is believed in the sub. If I tell you the cliff you are standing on is a mere illusion and the drop to the bottom is only one foot, you can consciously agree, I can even show you the math explaining the illusion, but you will not believe me, even if you willed yourself to jump, your stomach would lurch and you would brace your legs. To believe something isn't to idly agree or accept, but to be of the disposition to act on that knowledge. You can not truly simultaneously hold the belief that any exposure to sunlight will kill you, and then intentionally open the door and walk outside. If you truly held the belief, your sub would catch the impending behavior and fill your con with antagonizing thoughts of the sun in case you forgot. The important part is that the sub needs to hold the belief. This is a spectrum, the more you understand and believe something, the more implications it has on your actions. If anyone fully understood and believed in God, they would come crawling face down to mass. Likewise the sub can exist in a peculiar state of belief which seems contrary to the concept of belief but is all the same to the sub. Imagine a politician who continuously speaks on issues of diversity, equality, and justice, when they recently installed a gate to keep homeless people from getting too close to their house. Maybe they are fully aware of their hypocrisy, or maybe they have developed a niche brain which believes in saying words on diversity and equality, but through repetitive behavior has disassociated them with real life implications, similar to how the rules of chess no longer apply when you stop playing chess. This is  seen how I can swear with my internal voice, but never say a swear out loud. Complex brain states can be achieved.
## Faxioms
For almost everything you do in life, being grounded in the truth will help. In the mind, however, truth is but an option, you can use it to your advantage, but it is not necessary, and sometimes harmful. This might seem wrong, but just imagine the obvious case where a prisoner of war is in a camp that has been issued a warrant to execute all prisoners in two months. The prisoner who overhears this information will be filled with sorrow for the last two months of their life, while another who sees friendly planes flying overhead will be filled with hope and joy. Their fate is the same, yet objectively, the prisoner with hope lived a better life for their remaining two months. The concept I propose is that there are some ideas you can believe in, not because they are true, but because they will better your life. These beliefs need not even be false, but just unprovable, so long as believing in them causes you to act and think in a way that improves life. These are called faxioms 

, theory of the mind, completely made up by me, but models 


Good Faxioms:
Needs to be beneficial to life, but also easily distilled into unit actions which actually contribute to a higher belief.

> The better you treat people, the better they will treat you

Encourages you to be good to other

> Jesus promises eternal life

Ultimate hope, persistent beyond all other hopes

> There is only one right way, and you haven't found it yet

> You can do anything for one minute

The timescale is arbitrary. If it is a high intensity workout, one minute is good. If it is finals, a week is good, if it is a job, a year is good.


> You are better

You are better than everyone else, whats good enough for them is not simply good enough for you


> You can achieve anything if you work hard enough

Forces you to focus on how much work you are doing, not if the task is feasible


> Everything can be explained

Makes you try to perceive relationships and not let anything up to randomness or unknown


> People want to talk

You are probably as or more interesting than most It doesn't hurt to ask


> People will treat you the way you act

Don't interact on your own perceived self worth, always assume others think you're the goat


> Only the beginning is difficult

If you start things, your a lot more likely to actually do and finish them


> Do the things you fear the most to free your mind of them

Gets rid of all your fears


> Affirmation is poison

Information you already know is useless and will trick you into desiring affirmation and potentially leading to irrational ignorance of the truth when it so comes about. Only new information that disrupts your prediction is useful to refine your prediction

> If it doesn't improve you, its not worth doing

> Its not your birthday so don't act like it

> Your worth depends on your intelligence, strength, skill

> if you aren't doing it now, you never will

> You can be good at everything

Don't hybrid, don't minmax, just purely max, (at least physical, mental, and social)


> There is always an elegant solution with the right knowledge / idea

> Stay down till you come up or something

> They can copy everything but your mental state, it must be earned

> If it hasn't been done before, no one has thought of it

The "smart" guys w/o ideas that YCombinator gave ideas for a startup failed, need creative ideas throughout the whole process

Its not about how to get the thing that is difficult to get, its about how to love doing the thing that gets you something difficult

Change the constant, manipulate all the variables in the equation

The difference between the one who knows the equation and the one who creates it.


High quality dataset leads to finding lower order patterns easier, be neat!

It is always a design problem. The solution lies in finding the correct dataspace or perspective of the problem. It is all about the idea
