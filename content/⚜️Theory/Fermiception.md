So fermi paradox is why do we not see aliens even though it seems like life on other planets is so probable.

An advanced civilization would try to build a simulation of a universe to see how likely life would occur, to know if its just really unlikely or if there is something (or someone) else at play. 

Maybe we are a higher alien species experiment to solve their Fermi paradox.

If so, then likely the answer to the question is: yes, life is really rare, since it is only one this planet and of course the odds we are on the one iteration of the simulation that produced life is 100%, problem solved for them and us. If no, still a paradox...
