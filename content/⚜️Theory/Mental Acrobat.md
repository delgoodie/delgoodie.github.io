Fighter jets are designed to be statically unstable, meaning they need live wire PID feedback loops to adjust control surfaces that rely on electricity and computer systems. They do this because instability allows higher maneuverability.

To get max performance out of your mind requires a trade off of stability. Some mental health avenues might be difficult to balance and generally frowned upon but can lead to unparalleled levels of progress.

Only example I know of so far is Ego. Assigning self-worth to success motivates you at the core.
