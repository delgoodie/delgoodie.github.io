If morality is the determination of right or wrong actions, even in context, then what can be uncovered. The theories such as utilitarianism have a very materialistic perspective but from a believing standpoint, morality must ultimately align with God's will. If God doesn't think an action is good, it can in no way be morally good. This is not to say that morality is an arbitrary code decreed from God. It has apparent coherency and is written on our hearts, but it is also full of fog. 

A priest worships the Lord, holds masses for thousands, converts thousands, inspires the youth, feeds the poor. All these actions bring about good, they are good, everyone would say he is a good person. On the inside he operates solely out of desire for power. He yearns for public approval, praise, worship, he is obsessed with himself. God does not fuel any of his actions.

A man sees a vision revealing to him that his brother's wife is about to give birth to the antichrist, and that, once he is born, it will put into motion a conversion of society to a poisoned, degenerate state. He sneaks into their house into the night and murders the woman.

A boy welcomes his father home from a hard days work. Earlier that day, his brother was unfairly given a bad grade. The father asks the boy, what grade did your brother receive. He lies, telling his father that his brother received an A, to shield him from the punishment which would have ensued.

The first is good actions with bad intentions, the second is bad actions with good intentions, the third is questionable actions with questionable intentions. 

The action itself is irrelevant. Theoretically, any action could be constructed in such a context that the intention was good. This is obvious for cases like murder (self defense) or lying (eg 3) but for other cases such as rape it might be more difficult. At an extreme, however, a hypothetical could be constructed such as Abraham and Isaac, where simply God desired the action, and so the intention was to obey God, which is a recognizably good intention, even if the action was as horrifying as rape (luckily God would never command such an action!). To this point morality as a means of evaluating the good of an action is useless for deciding personal morality. Everything is in intention. The intention of an action, which can only ultimately be determined by God.

Many people, in not considering the mind, do not give much thought to intention. Purely operating as a behavioral specimen, they see and do. Most of this doing comes from either A) base needs such as eating, sleeping, peeing, sex, or B) the desire to belong. The desire to belong is particularly infamous and has corrupted so much of youth. On intention, it is important to do an action for the right intention, and know that you had the right intention. Intentions are not necessarily surfaced to the con, mainly because belief is held in the sub, and belief / desire, is the intention behind the action. We are mainly conscious of our subs beliefs, we put them there in the first place, but not always. As a result, even we can be deceived about the real reason we do things. Obviously, we must perturb our pure function, view it along different axiis to understand its true nature. To understand the intention of an action, you must start with a hypothesis. I believe I do X because of Y, and then create a situation in which Y does not exist. If you will still do X, it can be concluded that Y was not the motivation or intention of X. The opposite is not conclusive. 

> It is not enough to do something good, but you must do it for the right intention

Doing something for an intention will in turn provoke your sub to believe in that intention, thus doing charity for God will strengthen your belief in God, whereas doing it to be seen, will strengthen your desire to be seen (hockey puck). 

This extends far beyond simply morality. Coding to earn money will strengthen your desire for money, not the love of coding.
