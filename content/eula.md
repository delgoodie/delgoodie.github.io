## License Grant

Subject to this EULA and payment of all applicable fees, Delgoodie grants you a **personal, limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable** license to download and use one copy of the Game on a device you own or control, solely for **non-commercial entertainment**.

- **Platforms:** Steam and Epic Games Store (Windows & Linux).  
- **Online features:** matchmaking, leaderboards, cross-play, cloud save, and similar features may require **Epic Online Services (EOS)** and/or platform login.

We license the Game to you; we do **not** sell it to you. All rights not expressly granted are reserved by Delgoodie.

---

## Ownership & Content

The Game (including code, art, music, narrative, and any updates) is owned by Delgoodie and its licensors and is protected by copyright and other laws. Trademarks belong to their respective owners.

---

## Acceptable Use & Restrictions

You will **not**:

1. **Cheat or tamper:** use bots, aimbots, wallhacks, trainers, automation, packet editors, memory scanners, or any tool to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt others.  
2. **Bypass security:** interfere with or disable **Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)** or any DRM/anti-tamper, or attempt to access servers, data, or accounts without authorization.  
3. **Reverse engineer:** decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive source code, except to the extent allowed by mandatory law.  
4. **Commercialize:** sell, rent, lease, or sublicense the Game or access thereto; operate pay-to-play venues without our written permission.  
5. **Exploit bugs:** use known or unknown bugs/glitches for advantage; promptly report them.  
6. **Harass or violate rights:** engage in hate speech, harassment, doxxing, impersonation, or infringe IP/privacy rights.  
7. **Mods/UGC:** create, distribute, or use mods that (a) interact with the executable/process/memory, (b) affect online play, or (c) interfere with anti-cheat. Cosmetic client-side reshades and standard platform overlays are fine **if** they don’t trip anti-cheat. Ask us before releasing tools.

We may act against violations (see [Termination](#termination)).

---

## Online Services; Accounts; Cross-Play

- You need a **Steam** or **Epic** account to access platform services. Their terms apply.  
- Certain features use **EOS**. Cross-play may expose your **display name** and gameplay stats to other players.  
- **Cloud saves** are provided by the platform and/or EOS; availability may vary by platform and region.  
- We may run events, ranked ladders, or seasons at our discretion.

---

## Anti-Cheat Notice (EAC)

The Game integrates **Easy Anti-Cheat** (“EAC”). When the Game runs, EAC may run concurrently to detect unauthorized manipulations of the Game process, memory, and files. EAC may collect and analyze technical information (e.g., hardware/OS configuration, Game binaries’ integrity, drivers interacting with the Game process, suspicious patterns). If cheating or tampering is detected, **you may be blocked** from online play or banned from specific services. Use of the Game constitutes your consent to this anti-cheat processing.

---

## Data & Privacy

We process data as described in the **Astro Privacy Policy** (separate document). We rely on platform identity (Steam/Epic), use telemetry for operation and balancing, utilize **Sentry** for crash diagnostics, host on **AWS**, and do **not** run in-game ads. For rights requests or questions: **delgoodie.studio@gmail.com**.

---

## User-Generated Content (UGC) & Leaderboards

If you submit names, text, images, clips, or other content in or about the Game (collectively, “UGC”), you grant Delgoodie a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, sublicensable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and display that UGC in connection with operating and promoting the Game. You represent you have rights to your UGC and that it doesn’t violate law or others’ rights.

**Leaderboards** are public by design and may display your platform display name, region/queue, rank, and stats.

We may remove UGC at any time for any reason.

---

## Streaming & Content Creation

You may capture, stream, and monetize gameplay videos of Astro (including on YouTube/Twitch and similar) provided you: (a) comply with this EULA and platform policies; (b) don’t distribute the Game’s assets as standalone files; (c) don’t imply sponsorship or endorsement by Delgoodie; and (d) don’t use cheats. We may request takedown for misuse or infringement.

---

## Updates; Patches; Downtime

We may deploy updates, patches, balance changes, or content drops automatically. Some updates may be required to continue playing. Online services may be unavailable during maintenance or due to network/provider outages. Features can change or be discontinued at any time.

---

## Health & Safety

A small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns; stop playing immediately if you feel dizzy, nauseous, or unwell. Take regular breaks and ensure adequate space—Astro includes non-graphic cartoon violence and fast motion.

---

## Termination

This EULA is effective until terminated. It ends automatically if you breach it. We may suspend or terminate your access (including bans) for cheating, harassment, or EULA violations. Upon termination, you must uninstall the Game. Sections that by nature should survive (e.g., §§2,3,5,7,12–18) will survive.

---

## Refunds

Refunds are handled by the **store platform** (Steam or Epic) under their policies. We don’t provide direct refunds.

---

## Ephemeral / Competitive Data

Ranks, MMR, inventories, matchmaking, and event rewards are gameplay states, **not property**. We may adjust, reset, or remove them for balance, exploit cleanup, or integrity.

---

## Third-Party Services & Terms

Use of platform features, EOS, EAC, Sentry, and similar services is also subject to those providers’ terms and privacy policies. We aren’t responsible for third-party services we don’t control.

---

## Export Controls & Sanctions

You represent you are not located in, under control of, or a national or resident of any country or entity embargoed or sanctioned by the U.S. or other applicable jurisdictions, and you will comply with export control laws.

---

## Age Requirement

You must be **13 or older** to play. If you are under the age of majority in your jurisdiction, you represent that a parent or legal guardian has reviewed and accepted this EULA on your behalf.

---

## Disclaimers (No Warranties)

THE GAME IS PROVIDED **“AS IS”** AND **“AS AVAILABLE.”** TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DELGOODIE DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND ANY WARRANTIES ARISING FROM COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE GAME WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.

---

## Limitation of Liability

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, DELGOODIE, ITS AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY **INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES**, OR LOSS OF PROFITS, DATA, USE, GOODWILL, OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY. OUR TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS RELATING TO THE GAME WILL NOT EXCEED THE **AMOUNT YOU PAID** FOR THE GAME DURING THE 12 MONTHS BEFORE THE CLAIM, OR **USD $50**, WHICHEVER IS GREATER. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW EXCLUSIONS/LIMITS; IN THAT CASE, THEY APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED.

---

## Dispute Resolution; Governing Law

**Governing law:** This EULA is governed by the laws of the **State of New Hampshire, USA**, and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to conflict-of-law rules.

**Informal resolution first:** Before filing a claim, you agree to email us and attempt to resolve the issue informally for 30 days.

**Arbitration & venue (optional clause):** Except for claims for injunctive relief or IP rights, disputes will be resolved by **binding arbitration** on an individual basis under the rules of JAMS or AAA in **New Hampshire**, and you waive class actions and jury trials. If you don’t want arbitration, you may **opt out within 30 days** of first accepting this EULA by emailing **delgoodie.studio@gmail.com** with “Opt Out of Arbitration” and your account ID(s). If arbitration is unenforceable, exclusive venue is the state or federal courts in **New Hampshire**, and you consent to jurisdiction there.

---

## Changes to this EULA

We may update this EULA for legal, technical, or gameplay reasons. Material changes will be posted via store update notes, patch notes, or in-game notice and will apply going forward. If you continue using the Game after changes take effect, you accept the updated EULA.

---

## Miscellaneous

- **Severability:** If any part is unenforceable, the rest remains in effect.  
- **No waiver:** Failure to enforce isn’t a waiver.  
- **Assignment:** You may not assign this EULA; we may assign it to an affiliate or in connection with a merger or asset sale.  
- **Entire agreement:** This EULA plus the Privacy Policy and platform terms constitute the entire agreement for the Game.

---

## TL;DR (Non-Binding Summary)

Play fair, don’t cheat or harass, don’t break the client, streaming is okay, refunds go through the store, anti-cheat runs with the game, leaderboards are public, and we can patch whenever needed.
