Give me AI problems, I'll test my subconscious!

Ok so Sora gets hands wrong... Interestingly, the main way I become lucid in my dreams is because my brain gets hands wrong. Our subconscious is a biological chatgpt, lucid dreaming is the only way I know of to directly interface with it.

Im not the best LDer but could you guys give me types of problems that llms usually struggle with?

(like math, logic, or maybe other more simple problems)

I want to experiment more and see the comparisons between my Neural Net and chats. The more simple / profound the better, like hands is such a good example because we think of it as trivial but neural nets struggle so much.

I'll try to report back here if I get any findings or make a follow up post.
