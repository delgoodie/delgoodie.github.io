She's a big girl, not a short girl
She's a work girl, not a flirt girl
She crosses her legs, and fains her head
She drinks tea and coffee, is early to bed
She can do all the things that short girls do
But she just can't be a short girl too

Perspective...


Looking out the window, on a sunny day
Students of all majors playing, carefree and gay
But I study spatial orbits, they hardly leave my sight
A prisoner of my practice, morning noon and night

Peri, apoapsis, im expanding my vocab
if your looking for me I'll be in the matrix lab
Newton's Laws of gravity, quite frankly, lost me
In my head a cavity, please fill it, Knospe
