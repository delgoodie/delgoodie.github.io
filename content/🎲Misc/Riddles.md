The hairs on her head
Keep the deer fed
But unlike their elders
They never turn red
<!-- Grass -->

Sapphire crystal clear
Heated to a molten smear
Cooled into a dark basalt
With glints of mica mixed throughout
<!-- Sky -->

A rosy row of pigs in a cozy cave of wool
Five pigs, Ten pigs, then the cave's full
<!-- Toes / Socks -->

A region in space but a moment in time
A jot, a dash, a stroke, a line
A memory captured on a wall
A story with no words at all
<!-- Painting -->

You like it when you have it
I like it when I have it
We all like it when Jesus has it
<!-- Birthday -->

Light Consumed
2 Dimensions Removed
Etched into a tree, or what used to be
an object of gaze, for you and me
a treadmill for our memory
<!-- Photograph -->


What eats grass but feeds of anger
Surfaces the past and drinks from a manger
Walks on four legs, has two sides
Only one winner, served with fries
<!-- Beef -->


something about ants being like living quantized water or long line of cars


Crimson Dress
Carmine
Ruby
Blood
Sanguine
Your blushing but not the one who's red
She ushers you in closer, to kiss her on the lips
BUt as you hands surround her, she pricks your fingertips
