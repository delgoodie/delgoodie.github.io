Cold showering for Lent (40 days)

The first day felt amazing. The shower was very painful, went into shock and couldn't breathe for first couple seconds. Muscles very tense and shivering blue. After it was finished I had a million pounds of energy bursting from my body and I just "felt good" for no reason.

After more showers, it became more bearable and also less exciting and more miserable since I didn't get as much of a rush from just doing the shower, and also didn't feel as crazy afterward. I suppose everything that gives pleasure has its limits.

Going on spring break, cold showers are much less cold (hotel shower is warm) so the step back to UVA will be a jolt, however, I suppose the relative pain is similar since I am experiencing so much pleasure on break (foods, hot tub, no work, etc)


After lent, still going strong!


best motivation is to think about how bearable the cold shower will be after ~3min and how amazing it will feel afterward. Then crucially, after 3min i remember how i felt at the start of the shower, to remind myself of that feeling in light of how bearable it is now. also repeat after shower is finished.


Been forcing myself to do things after done washing to make sure im in it for the cold, not just the wash. Mainly just stand sideways (most painful angle on underarms) or touch my toes or face directly into the water


67 days in and its pretty easy now, also weather is heating up. I haven't gotten sick but I do get more frequent headaches, maybe related. I love it tho.


83 days in, doesn't phase me but also lost its allure, kinda just the thing i do now, and def could not go back to warm showers. the hype after isn't as real anymore tho


389 days and counting - really have no thought of warm showers. Still stand in shower for a while before turning on the water though. Experience no shock. No desire to turn back but also no dopamine high.
