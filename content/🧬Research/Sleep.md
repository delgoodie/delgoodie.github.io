Laying horizontally causes blood to pump more efficiently, circulating and dissipating heat through bloodstream, lowering body temperature and making you more sleepy.

Babies need to sleep short and often because they can't go more than 2hrs without feeding and they need REM sleep!

As we age we naturally get less REM and more deep, probably to "solidify" brain.

Everyone has a natural dip in alertness from 1-4p, best time for naps. Take nap earlier in the day, rather than later.

20 min is optimal nap length.
