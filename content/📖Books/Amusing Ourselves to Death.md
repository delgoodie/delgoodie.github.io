Argues that picture / video media is fundamentally making America less intelligent as compared to the "print" age. Reading text requires an active mental state and demands decomposing sentence structure, clauses, etc to extract meaning. On top of the base mechanical layer, you need to understand the authors argument and decide if you agree with them (he mostly assumes non-fiction or sometimes political). TV is passively streamed into your brain.

Ultimately, he mainly conveys that TV's primary purpose is entertainment. Its not impossible to convey meaningful information in video format, but video format has been geared towards entertainment, such that all information through TV, youtube, etc, must firstly, entertain. Because of this limitation, its harder to communicate information.

#### Now This
The phrasing of repeated news headlines which are all extreme and irrelevant to the viewer but feel like important information. Postman argues that news facts are trivial because you cannot make any meaningful action on them (*100% agree*) and the newscasters play music and talk cordially about natural disasters, murders, fires, etc, desensitizing people to these events.

#### Commercials
Products are trying to be sold as a form of therapy. Instead of trying to convince the viewer to buy your product, you are trying to convince them that they are the kind of person who buys your product or that they want to live the lifestyle of the kind of people who buy your product. No words, just emotional symbolism. Optimized for their extremely short durations and don't rely on the product itself being actually better than competitors. 
Politicians do the same:

> For on television the politician does not so much offer the audience an image of himself, as offer himself as an image of the audience. 


Lincoln v Douglass debates went on for hours with each taking >1 hr uninterrupted monologues. No one today could ever have that kind of attention span.





# Conclusions
First, I do think there is some inherent intellectual value in reading text. Like it just requires more raw brainpower to understand text, more so than hearing and seeing, although this is minimal and isn't a high bar for the sub.

More importantly, I think what Postman couldn't see in fullness is that it is one large spectrum. Humans can choose one the one hand, to read very painful non-fiction, and on the other hand, beam tiktok into their brains. The issue is that we have structured content in the form of a democracy. First through capitalism allowing the TV producers to make more money than authors, and then in social media platforms for using algorithms that are fundamentally democratic. Unfortunately, I feel that democracy is actually wrong for entertainment. 

The problem is perfectly seen in youtube thumbnails. If I show you 10 thumbnails, 9 of which have low saturation, and the 10th has high saturation, your eyes will go to the 10th. This is physiological, rationality is not at play. Due to the law of large numbers, the 10th video will, on average, have more clicks than the other nine. Then, due to the democratic process favoring the 10th, a pseudo evolution will take place, causing only youtubers who make saturated thumbnail to rise to the top. Once everyone is making saturated thumbnails, they are not standing out among each other, but no one can go back. We are then left with what other side-effects are caused by all thumbnails being oversaturated. Saturation itself isn't particularly deadly, but the loss of cognitive ability from scrolling reels all day is. Basically, anytime where the decision is made but something other than rationality, where human nature is in control, not the mind, democracy is not the most optimal choice.

This, compounds with the problem that, in entertainment, EVERYTHING is competing with EVERYTHING. Mario Kart Wii is competing with iMax. They all want to corner the "what you do in your free time" market. Because of this meta-market, whole markets themselves are "high-saturation" optimizing. That is why, in the book he describes newspapers as decreasing the number of words, increasing pictures, becoming more "TV-like". That's why video-games, TV shows, tiktok, youtube, etc are all doomed to converge on one another, in the ultimate optimization algorithm for dopamine. These products cannot stably coexist, as long as there is one human nature. The caveat to this is obviously that some people can get more dopamine from an AMA post, whereas others get more from holding mid, but we are way more similar than we are different and Tiktok has proved that none, not even Papa, can escape the pure thrill of 5 second videos. 

The side effect here, of importance, is that the most optimal forms of entertainment minimize thinking. Thinking is painful, a physiological consequence of the the fact that thinking requires calories. Don't waste calories if you don't need to. Don't make the audience experience pain by thinking. Importantly, once people are thinking, such as picking between two blenders side-by-side in Walmart, democracy is optimal, since they will choose the best blender in that they choose the best object for blending. Give people the choice to think or not to think, and they, due to human nature will choose not to think, however, there is some implicit assumption that this is not good for them, now explicit. I don't think this is hard to justify. The "ideal" person has critical thinking skills, isn't a lump of flesh. Exercising is painful, but there is dopamine rewarded from exercise and there are other social motivations such as looking good or being good at a sport. Reading does not incur the same social benefits. Also obviously there is dopamine and incentive to think still and not go on Tiktok, etc. That's why I exist. Its just not the most optimal for the largest number of people. That's why Thomas' friend at Tech casually has 30mil views on Tiktok. 

All of this is heightened by our massive material wealth and relief of producing the most primitive needs like food and housing, giving us way more free time than any other point in history. (*most people have BS jobs*)

Overall, the current state is a combination of:

1. Democracy (freedom of choice) is only optimal when driven by rationality
2. Entertainment selection is not driven by rationality (rather human nature)
3. Everything is competing with everything (for your time)
4. We have wayyy to much free time
5. The side effect of optimal entertainment is (but not limited to) decreased ability to think


How it could be fixed:
- decrease cross-market competition (rate limiting like you can spend 1 hr per day on a tiktok-like platform, 1hr per day gaming)
- remove democratic process (new algorithms)
- decrease free time (idk labor camps?)
- gmo humans to not have human nature
