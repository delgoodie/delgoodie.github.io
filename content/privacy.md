## Who We Are & Scope

**Astro** ships on **Steam** and the **Epic Games Store**. We use platform identities (Steam/Epic). We do not run a separate tracking website, ad tech, or newsletter for Astro.

---

## Quick Summary

- **Accounts:** Steam/Epic only. No first-party account.
- **Collection:** gameplay telemetry (match stats, MMR, session times, heatmaps, replays) and diagnostics (crash/error data).
- **No voice recording.**
- **Anti-cheat:** Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC).
- **Payments:** handled by Steam/Epic.
- **Cloud saves & cross-play:** via platform/EOS.
- **No ads; no sale or “sharing” for cross-context behavioral ads.**
- **Rights requests:** email **delgoodie.studio@gmail.com**.

---

## What We Collect

We don’t directly collect names, emails, or payment card data. We receive and process:

### Identifiers & Platform Data
- Platform IDs/tokens (e.g., SteamID, Epic IDs), display name.
- Ownership/entitlements, friend/party membership (where features are used).
- IP address and coarse network metadata (security, routing/region selection).

### Gameplay & Telemetry
- Session start/end time, duration, region/queue, ping/packet loss.
- Match stats, MMR/elo-like ratings and rank, heatmaps, replays, leaderboard entries.

### Diagnostics
- Crash reports and logs (stack traces, OS/device specs, driver/renderer info, game build/version, memory state at crash), performance counters.

### Anti-Cheat
- Signals required to detect cheating and enforce integrity (via **EAC**).

### We Do **Not** Collect
- Voice chat recordings or transcripts.
- Precise geolocation.
- Payment card details (processed by Steam/Epic).
- Support ticket system data (email only if you contact us).

---

## Why We Process Data (Legal Bases)

- **Run the service:** authentication via platform IDs, entitlements, matchmaking, cross-play, cloud save, server routing. **(Contract / Legitimate Interests)**
- **Fair play & safety:** prevent/detect/respond to cheating, abuse, or fraud; enforce bans. **(Legitimate Interests / Contract)**
- **Diagnostics & quality:** crash analysis, performance tuning, balance/telemetry, bug triage, security. **(Legitimate Interests)**
- **Compliance:** respond to lawful requests and enforce terms. **(Legal Obligation)**

We do **not** use your data for behavioral advertising and do **not** sell it.

---

## Children

Astro is **not directed to children under 13**. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child provided information, contact **delgoodie.studio@gmail.com** to delete it.

---

## In-Game Social, UGC & Leaderboards

- **Leaderboards** are public by design and display your **platform display name**, rank, and stats.
- **Chat/voice moderation** is limited to what the platform/EOS provides. We do not store voice.
- We may retain **ban evidence** (e.g., cheat signals, logs) for audit and abuse-prevention.

---

## Third-Party Providers

We use established vendors to operate features. Their terms/privacy policies apply to their processing:

- **Epic Online Services (EOS)** — identity, cross-play, sessions/lobbies, and related online features.
- **Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC)** — anti-cheat detection and enforcement; may run with the game client to detect manipulation.
- **Sentry** — crash/error telemetry (stack traces, device/OS/app version, IP for security/rate limiting, diagnostic context).
- **Steam / Valve** — platform identity, ownership, cloud/achievements; payments processed by Steam.
- **Epic Games Store** — platform identity and store services; payments processed by Epic.
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** — hosting and storage infrastructure.

We engage these providers as **processors** (or platforms acting as independent controllers). We do not grant them rights to use your data for their own advertising.

---

## Data Sharing & Selling

- We **do not sell** personal information.
- We **do not share** personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
- We disclose data only to service providers above, to comply with law, protect our rights/users, or during a merger/asset transfer.

---

## Retention

We keep data only as long as needed, then delete or anonymize.

- **Platform identifiers/account state:** while access remains active and up to **24 months** after last activity (fraud/ban integrity).
- **Telemetry (match stats, MMR, heatmaps):** **18 months** rolling.
- **Crash logs & diagnostics:** **12 months**.
- **Replays:** **30–90 days** (older replays may be purged sooner).
- **Leaderboards:** until removed/reset; historical snapshots may be anonymized.
- **Ban evidence:** up to **5 years** to prevent evasion.
- **IP/security logs:** **30–90 days** unless needed longer for investigations.

---

## Security

We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures: encryption in transit, least-privilege access controls, environment segregation, audit logging, rate limiting/DDoS protections, and secret management. No system is perfectly secure; we continually refine controls.

---

## International Transfers

If you’re in the EU/UK, data may be processed in the U.S. and other countries. We use appropriate safeguards such as **Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs)** via our processors (e.g., AWS) for international transfers.

---

## Your Rights & How to Use Them

Depending on your location (e.g., EU/UK GDPR, California CPRA, Virginia, etc.), you may have rights to:

- **Access** the data we hold about you.  
- **Correct** inaccurate data.  
- **Delete** your data (subject to safety/legal exceptions).  
- **Object** or **restrict** certain processing.  
- **Data portability** (where applicable).  
- **Appeal** a refusal (US states).

**To exercise rights:** email **delgoodie.studio@gmail.com** with your platform ID(s) (Steam/Epic), region, and request. We may ask for verification. We aim to respond within **30–45 days**.

**Cloud saves & replays:** Deletion requests will include cloud-stored content we control. Platform cloud saves may require using Steam/Epic tools as well.

---

## Cookies & Tracking

We do **not** operate a tracking website for Astro and do **not** use cookies or a consent banner. If this changes, we’ll update this Policy and post a cookie notice.

---

## Automated Decision-Making

We use automated decision-making for:

- **Ranked matchmaking** (placing you into games based on skill signals).
- **Anti-cheat** (detecting/blocking cheating; serious cases may involve account/device restrictions).

Contact us to request more info about these systems. Some details may be withheld to protect anti-cheat integrity.

---

## Do Not Track / GPC

We do not operate a tracking website or cross-context ads. If we add a site with cookies, we will honor applicable **Global Privacy Control (GPC)** signals where required.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We’ll update this Policy when we add features, change processors, or when law requires. Material changes will be communicated via patch notes, store update notes, or an in-game notice. The **Effective date** reflects when it took effect.
