Privacy Policy — Astro

Effective date: January 1, 2025
Company: Delgoodie LLC (“we”, “us”, “our”)
Contact: delgoodie.studio@gmail.com

Covered services: the Astro video game (Windows & Linux), related online services (matchmaking, leaderboards, telemetry), and support email. No separate website tracking is covered here.

1) Who we are & scope

This Policy explains what information is processed when you play Astro on Steam or Epic Games Store and use our online features. We do not run first-party ad tech, and we don’t operate a tracking website or newsletter.

2) Summary (the short version)

We rely on platform identities (Steam/Epic). We don’t run our own account system.
We collect game telemetry (match stats, MMR, session times, heatmaps, replays), and diagnostics (crash reports, device specs) to run, secure, and improve the game.
No in-game ads. No voice recording.
Anti-cheat is provided by Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC).
Cloud saves and cross-play occur via the platforms/EOS.
We don’t sell or share your data for cross-context behavioral advertising.
You can request access or deletion via delgoodie.studio@gmail.com.

3) What we collect (and from where)

We don’t directly collect your name, email, or payment info. The categories below come from gameplay, your device, and the platform SDKs:

Identifiers & platform data
    Platform IDs and tokens (e.g., SteamID, Epic Account/User/Product IDs), display name, entitlements/ownership checks, friend/party membership (if used), ban status.
IP address and coarse network metadata (for security, DDoS mitigation, region selection).

Gameplay & telemetry
    Session start/end time, session duration, region/queue, ping/packet-loss, input timings, match stats, MMR/elo-like ratings and rank, heatmaps, replays, leaderboard entries.

Diagnostics
    Crash reports and logs (stack traces, OS/device specs, driver/renderer info, installed game version/build, memory state at crash), app performance counters.

Anti-cheat
    Signals necessary to detect cheating and enforce rules (details handled by EAC; see Third-Party Processors).

We do not collect
- Voice chat recordings or transcripts (voice is relayed by the platform/EOS and not stored by us).
- Precise geolocation (we infer region from IP for routing only).
- Payment card data (handled by Steam/Epic).
- Support ticket system data (we don’t run a ticket portal; email only if you contact us).

4) Why we process data (purposes) & legal bases

Run the service: authenticate via platform IDs, entitlements, matchmaking, cross-play, cloud save sync, server routing. (Contract / Legitimate Interests)
Fair play & safety: prevent, detect, and respond to cheating, abuse, or fraud; enforce bans. (Legitimate Interests / Contract)
Diagnostics & quality: crash analysis, performance tuning, balance/telemetry, bug triage, and security. (Legitimate Interests)
Compliance: respond to lawful requests and enforce terms. (Legal Obligation)

We don’t use your data for behavioral advertising or sell it.

5) Children

Astro is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe a child has provided us information, contact delgoodie.studio@gmail.com to delete it.

If you actually want 12+, tell us and we’ll add COPPA parental-consent mechanics and notices.

6) In-game social & UGC

Leaderboards are public by design and display your platform display name, rank, and stats.
Chat/voice moderation is limited to what the platform/EOS provides. We do not store voice.
We retain ban evidence (e.g., cheat signals, logs) for audit and abuse-prevention.

7) Third-party processors (what they do; links)

We use well-known vendors to operate features. Their policies apply to their processing:

Epic Online Services (EOS) — identity, cross-play, friends, lobbies/sessions, and other online features; EOS enforces app-level consent for certain data access. 
Epic Games / Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC) — anti-cheat detection and enforcement, including automated decision-making to detect anomalies and misuse; EAC provides general security guidance and requirements. 
Sentry — crash and error telemetry; typical collection can include crash stack traces, device/OS/app version, IP address (for security/rate limiting and geolocation), and diagnostic context (configurable). 
Steam / Valve — platform identity, ownership, achievements, cloud services, and store infrastructure subject to Valve’s privacy terms. Payments are processed by Steam. 
Epic Games Store — platform identity, ownership, and store services subject to Epic’s privacy policy. Payments are processed by Epic. 
Amazon Web Services (AWS) — hosting and storage. AWS’s GDPR Data Processing Addendum incorporates Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) for EU data exports. 

We contract these providers as processors (or platforms acting as independent controllers). We do not grant them rights to use your data for their own advertising.

8) Data sharing & “selling”

We do not sell personal information.
We do not share personal information for cross-context behavioral advertising.
We disclose data only to service providers above, to comply with law, protect our rights and users, or during a merger/asset transfer.

9) Retention

We keep data only as long as necessary for the purposes above, then delete or anonymize. Default windows (tune these if you want tighter/looser):
Platform identifiers & account state: as long as your game access remains active and for up to 24 months after last activity for fraud/ban integrity.
Telemetry (match stats, MMR, heatmaps): 18 months rolling.
Crash logs & diagnostics: 12 months.
Replays: 30–90 days (older replays may be purged sooner for storage).
Leaderboards: until removed or reset; historic snapshots may be anonymized.
Ban evidence: up to 5 years to prevent evasion.
IP logs & security events: 30–90 days unless needed longer for investigations.

10) Security

We use reasonable technical and organizational measures: encryption in transit, access controls with least privilege, environment segregation, audit logging, rate-limiting/DDoS protections, and secret management. Anti-cheat enforcement is handled by EAC. No security system is perfect; we continuously refine controls.

11) International transfers

If you’re in the EU/UK, your data may be processed in the U.S. and other countries. When we transfer personal data internationally, we rely on appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) via our processors (e.g., AWS). 
Amazon Web Services, Inc.
AWS Static

12) Your rights

Depending on your location (e.g., EU/UK GDPR, California CPRA, Virginia, etc.), you may have rights to:
- Access the data we hold about you.
- Correct inaccurate data.
- Delete your data (subject to safety/legal exceptions).
- Object or restrict certain processing.
- Data portability (where applicable).
- Appeal a refusal (US states).

How to exercise rights: email delgoodie.studio@gmail.com with your platform ID(s) (Steam/Epic), region, and request. We may ask for additional verification to prevent abuse. We aim to respond within 30–45 days.

Cloud saves & replays: Deletion requests will include cloud-stored content we control. Platform-level cloud saves controlled by Steam/Epic may require you to use the platform tools as well.

13) Cookies & tracking

We do not operate a tracking website for Astro and do not use cookies or a consent banner. If this changes (e.g., launching a website or newsletter), we’ll post an updated policy with a cookie notice.

14) Automated decision-making

We use automated decision-making for:
- Ranked matchmaking (placing you into games based on skill signals).
- Anti-cheat (detecting and blocking cheating, including account/device restrictions in serious cases).

You can contact us to request more information about the logic involved and the significance of these decisions to you. Some details may be withheld to protect the integrity of anti-cheat.

15) Do Not Track / GPC

We do not operate a tracking website and do not serve cross-context ads. If we add a website with cookies in the future, we will honor applicable Global Privacy Control (GPC) signals for opt-out where required.

16) Changes to this Policy

We’ll update this Policy when we add features, processors, or legal requirements change. Material changes will be communicated via patch notes, store update notes, or an in-game notice. The “Effective date” shows when it took effect.
