## Wut is this

These are my personal notes from the past 4 years that I'm transforming from our internal dev onboarding guide.

I'm aiming to process about one section a day since the conversion from onenote/evernote/confluence is lossy and needs a final human pass to clean up little niggles.

## Site Build Instructions

- Originally built with gatsby, migrating to mkdocs
- My notes related to the webdev of the site are in the gitrepo/docs folder
- Webdev is pita. I never use the live site anymore so ymmv; your best bet experience is cloning and opening locally
  - I use and _✨ recommend ✨_ [obsidian](https://obsidian.md); no affiliation, it's just free, fast, sparks joy with zero setup (just open the notes folder)
  - [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/) or [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) are also great alternatives
  - or for the lazy, [vscode.dev//gamedevguide](https://vscode.dev/github/ikrima/gamedevguide) or [github.dev//gamedevguide](https://github.dev/ikrima/gamedevguide)
